= Configuration of permission policies administrators

The permission policies for users and groups in the {product-short} are managed by permission policy administrators. Only permission policy administrators can access the Role-Based Access Control REST API. 

You can set the credentials of a permission policy administrator in the `app-config.yaml` file as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    admin:
      users:
        - name: user:default/joeuser
