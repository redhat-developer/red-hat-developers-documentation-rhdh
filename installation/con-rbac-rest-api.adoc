= Role-based Access Control (RBAC) REST API

{product} provides RBAC REST API that you can use to manage the permissions and roles in the {product-short}. This API supports you to facilitate and automate the maintenance of {product-short} permission policies and roles.

Using the RBAC REST API, you can perform the following actions:

* Retrieve information about all permission policies or specific permission policies, or roles
* Create, update, or delete a permission policy or a role
* Retrieve permission policy information about static plugins

The RBAC REST API requires the following components:

*Authorization*

The RBAC REST API requires Bearer token authorization for the permitted user role. For development purposes, you can access a web console in a browser. When you refresh a token request in the list of network requests, you find the token in the response JSON.

`Authorization: Bearer $token`

*HTTP methods*

The RBAC REST API supports the following HTTP methods for API requests:

* `GET`: Retrieves specified information from a specified resource endpoint
* `POST`: Creates or updates a resource
* `PUT`: Updates a resource
* `DELETE`: Deletes a resource

*Base URL*

The base URL for RBAC REST API requests is `http://SERVER:PORT/api/permission/policies`, such as `http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies`.

*Endpoints*

RBAC REST API endpoints, such as `/api/permission/policies/[kind]/[namespace]/[name]` for specified kind, namespace, and username, are the URI that you append to the base URL to access the corresponding resource.

Example request URL for `/api/permission/policies/[kind]/[namespace]/[name]` endpoint is:

`http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies/user/default/johndoe`

[NOTE]
====
If permission is assigned to a user, then the example request URL mentioned previously returns a result. However, if permission is only assigned to roles, then the example request URL does not return an output.

*Request data*

HTTP `POST` requests in the RBAC REST API may require a JSON request body with data to accompany the request.

Example `POST` request URL and JSON request body data for
`http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies`:
