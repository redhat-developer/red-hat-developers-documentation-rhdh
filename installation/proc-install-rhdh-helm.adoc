= Installing {product} using Helm Chart

You can use a Helm Chart in Red Hat OpenShift (OpenShift) to install {product}, which is a flexible installation method.

Helm is a package manager on OpenShift that provides the following features:

* Applies regular application updates using custom hooks
* Manages the installation of complex applications
* Provides charts that you can host on public and private servers
* Supports rolling back to previous application versions

The {product} Helm Chart is available in the Helm catalog in Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated and OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the OCP using the OpenShift web console.
* You have configured the appropriate roles and permissions within your project to create an application.

.Procedure

. Create a project in the OpenShift, if not present.
+
For more information about creating a project in OpenShift, see link: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/projects.html#create-a-project[Red Hat OpenShift documentation]. 
. Switch to *Developer* perspective on your Red Hat OpenShift web console.
. Click *+Add*.
. From the *Developer Catalog* panel, click *Helm Chart*.
. Search for _Developer Hub_ in the search bar and select the *{product}* card.
. Click *Create*.
. Copy the OpenShift router host (for example: `apps.<clusterName>.com`) to *Root Schema* -> *global* -> *Shorthand for users who do not want to specify a custom HOSTNAME. Used ONLY with the DEFAULT upstream.backstage.appConfig value and with OCP Route enabled.*, and adjust the other values if needed.

. Alternatively, copy the OpenShift router host (for example: `apps.<clusterName>.com`) to `global.clusterRouterBase`, and adjust other values if needed, such as `global.clusterRouterBase: apps.example.com`.

--
In the previous steps, the information about the host is copied, which is accessed by the {product-short} backend. 

When an OCP route is generated automatically, the host value for the route is inferred and the same host information is sent to the {product-short}. Also, if the {product-short} is present on a custom domain by setting the host manually using values, the custom host takes precedence.
--

. Click *Create* and wait for the database and {product} to start.
. Click the *Open URL* option to start using the {product} platform.

[NOTE]
====
If your `developer-hub` pod is stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` and you see the following logs:

[source,log]
----
Loaded config from app-config-from-configmap.yaml, env
...
2023-07-24T19:44:46.223Z auth info Configuring "database" as KeyStore provider type=plugin
Backend failed to start up Error: Missing required config value at 'backend.database.client'
----

Then, verify the configuration files. This is because the configuration files are not being accessed by the RHDH container.
