= Installing {product} using Helm Chart

You can use a Helm Chart in Red Hat OpenShift (OpenShift) to install {product}, which is a flexible installation method.

Helm is a package manager on OpenShift that provides the following features:

* Applies regular application updates using custom hooks
* Manages the installation of complex applications
* Provides charts that you can host on public and private servers
* Supports rolling back to previous application versions

The {product} Helm Chart is available in the Helm catalog in Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated and OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the OCP using the OpenShift web console.
* You have configured the appropriate roles and permissions within your project to create an application.

.Procedure

. Create a project in the OpenShift, if not present.
+
For more information about creating a project in OpenShift, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/applications/projects/working-with-projects.html#odc-creating-projects-using-developer-perspective_projects[Red Hat OpenShift documentation]. 
. Switch to *Developer* perspective on your Red Hat OpenShift web console.
. Click *+Add*.
. From the *Developer Catalog* panel, click *Helm Chart*.
. Search for _Developer Hub_ in the search bar and select the *{product}* card.
. Click *Create*.
. Use one of the following views to edit the Helm configuration:

** Using *Form view* 
+
.. Copy the OpenShift router host (for example: `apps.<clusterName>.com`) and paste it in the *Root Schema* -> *global* -> *Shorthand for users who do not want to specify a custom HOSTNAME. Used ONLY with the DEFAULT upstream.backstage.appConfig value and with OCP Route enabled.* field, and edit the other values if needed.
.. Click *Create* and wait for the database and {product} to start.

** Using *YAML view* 
+
.. Copy the OpenShift router host (for example: `apps.<clusterName>.com`) and paste it in the `global.clusterRouterBase` parameter value as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
global:
  auth:
    backend:
      enabled: true
  clusterRouterBase: apps.<clusterName>.com
  # other Red Hat Developer Hub Helm Chart configurations
----
.. Click *Create* and wait for the database and {product} to start.
+
--
Whether you edit the Helm configuration using the *Form view* or the *YAML view*, the copied information about the host is accessed by the {product-short} backend. 

When an OpenShift Container Platform route is generated automatically, the host value for the route is inferred and the same host value is sent to the {product-short}. Also, if you have set up the host manually to configure {product-short} on a custom domain, the custom host value for the route takes precedence.
--

. Click the *Open URL* option to start using the {product} platform.

[NOTE]
====
If your `developer-hub` pod is stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` and you see the following logs:

[source,log]
----
Loaded config from app-config-from-configmap.yaml, env
...
2023-07-24T19:44:46.223Z auth info Configuring "database" as KeyStore provider type=plugin
Backend failed to start up Error: Missing required config value at 'backend.database.client'
----

Then, verify the configuration files. This is because the configuration files are not being accessed by the RHDH container.
