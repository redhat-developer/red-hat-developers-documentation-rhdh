= Installing {product} using Helm Chart

You can use a Helm Chart in Red Hat OpenShift (OpenShift) to install {product}, which is a flexible installation method.

Helm is a package manager on OpenShift that provides the following features:

* Applies regular application updates using custom hooks
* Manages the installation of complex applications
* Provides charts that you can host on public and private servers
* Supports rolling back to previous application versions

The {product} Helm chart is available in the Helm catalog in Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) or on ArtifactHUB.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the OCP using the OpenShift web console.
* You have configured the appropriate roles and permissions within your project to create an application.

.Procedure

. Create a project in the OpenShift, if not present.
+
For more information about creating a project in OpenShift, see link: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/projects.html#create-a-project[Red Hat OpenShift documentation]. 
. Switch to *Developer* mode on your Red Hat OpenShift web console.
. Click *+Add*.
. From the *Developer Catalog* panel, click *Helm Chart*.
. Search for _Developer Hub_ in the search bar and select the *{product}* card.
. Click *Create*.
. Copy the OpenShift router host from *Root Schema* -> *global* -> *clusterRouterBase*, and adjust the other values if needed.
+
--
In this step, the information about the host is copied, which is accessed by the Developer Hub backend. 

When an OCP route is generated automatically, the host value for the route is inferred and the same host information is sent to the Developer Hub. Also, if the Developer Hub is present on a custom domain by setting the host manually using values, the custom host takes precedence.
--

. Click *Create* and wait for the database and {product} to start.
. Click the *Open URL* option to start using the {product} platform.

[NOTE]
====
In case your `developer-hub` pod is stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` and you see the following logs:

[source,log]
----
Loaded config from app-config-from-configmap.yaml, env
...
2023-07-24T19:44:46.223Z auth info Configuring "database" as KeyStore provider type=plugin
Backend failed to start up Error: Missing required config value at 'backend.database.client'
----

Then, verify the configuration files. This is because the configuration files are not being accessed by the RHDH container.
