* To modifying your homepage layout, look for the *Edit* button on your dashboard. Click this button to activate the customization mode, allowing you to personalize the interface.

* Move cards around and resize their positions on your homepage using the drag-and-drop functionality.

* Remove existing cards from your personal homepage that are not necessary for your daily tasks.

* Integrate additional tools and information into your customized view by adding new cards by selecting from a list of available dynamic plugins within {product-very-short}. These new cards will display content relevant to your tasks, respecting any existing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules.

Any changes and modifications you make are automatically saved and persist across sessions and devices. This ensures that your optimized layout is retained every time you log in to {product-very-short}.

* To discard your changes and restore the organizational standard, revert your end-user customization back to the default homepage settings provided by your organization at any time.
