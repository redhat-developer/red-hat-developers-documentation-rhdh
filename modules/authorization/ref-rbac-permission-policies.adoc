= Permission policies reference

Permission policies in {product} are a set of rules to govern access to resources or functionalities. These policies state the authorization level that is granted to users based on their roles. The permission policies are implemented to maintain security and confidentiality within a given environment.

You can define the following types of permissions in {product-short}:

* resource type
* basic

The distinction between the two permission types depends on whether a permission includes a defined resource type.

You can define the resource type permission using either the associated resource type or the permission name as shown in the following example:

.Example resource type permission definition
[source,csv]
----
p, role:default/myrole, catalog.entity.read, read, allow
g, user:default/myuser, role:default/myrole

p, role:default/another-role, catalog-entity, read, allow
g, user:default/another-user, role:default/another-role
----

You can define the basic permission in {product-short} using the permission name as shown in the following example:

.Example basic permission definition
[source,csv]
----
p, role:default/myrole, catalog.entity.create, create, allow
g, user:default/myuser, role:default/myrole
----

OCM permissions::

Basic OCM permissions only restrict access to the cluster view, but they do not prevent access to the Kubernetes clusters in the resource view. For more effective permissions, consider applying a conditional policy to restrict access to catalog entities that are of type `kubernetes-cluster`. Access restriction is dependent on the set of permissions granted to a role. For example, if the role had full permissions (`read`, `update`, and `delete`), then you must specify all its permissions in the `permissionMapping` field.

.Example permissionMapping definition
[source,csv]
----
result: CONDITIONAL
roleEntityRef: 'role:default/<YOUR_ROLE>'
pluginId: catalog
resourceType: catalog-entity
permissionMapping: 
  - read
  - update
  - delete
conditions: 
  not: 
    rule: HAS_SPEC
    resourceType: catalog-entity
    params: 
      key: type
