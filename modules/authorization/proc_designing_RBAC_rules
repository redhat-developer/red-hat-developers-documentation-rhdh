= Policy effect

The policy effect determines whether the access request must be approved if multiple policy rules match the request.

.Default policy effect

The default policy effect is deny, meaning that if no rules match the access request, the request is denied.

.Conflicting rules

When one rule permits and the other denies it, the deny rule takes precedence.

.Policy design considerations

To prevent unintended access denials, follow these guidelines when designing policies:
* Use `permit` rules to explicitly allow access.
* Rely on the default `deny` effect for all other cases.
* You must not set explicit `deny` rules unless they are required to override existing permit rules.
