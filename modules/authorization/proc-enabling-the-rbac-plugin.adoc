= Enabling and giving access to the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature is disabled by default.
Enable the RBAC plugin and declare policy administrators to start using RBAC features.

The permission policies for users and groups in the {product-short} are managed by permission policy administrators. Only permission policy administrators can access the Role-Based Access Control REST API.

.Prerequisites
* You have link:{linkadminguide}#assembly-add-custom-app-file-openshift_admin-rhdh[added a custom {product-short} application configuration], and have sufficient permissions to modify it.
* You have link:{authentication-book-title}[enabled an authentication provider].

.Procedure
. The RBAC plugin is installed but disabled by default.
To enable the  `./dynamic-plugins/dist/janus-idp-backstage-plugin-rbac` plugin, edit your `dynamic-plugins.yaml` with the following content.
+
.`dynamic-plugins.yaml` fragment
[source,yaml]
----
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/janus-idp-backstage-plugin-rbac
    disabled: false
----
+
See link:{installing-and-viewing-dynamic-plugins-url}[{installing-and-viewing-dynamic-plugins-title}].

. Declare policy administrators to enable a select number of authenticated users to configure RBAC policies through the REST API or Web UI, instead of modifying the CSV file directly.
The permissions can be specified in a separate CSV file referenced in the `app-config-rhdh` ConfigMap, or permissions can be created using the REST API or Web UI.
+
To declare users such as _<your_policy_administrator_name>_ as policy administrators, edit your custom {product-short} ConfigMap, such as `app-config-rhdh`, and add following code to the `app-config-rhdh.yaml` content:
+
.`app-config.yaml` fragment
[source,yaml,subs=+quotes]
----
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    admin:
      users:
        - name: user:default/__<your_policy_administrator_name>__
----

.Verification
. Sign out from the existing {product} session and log in again using the declared policy administrator account.
