= Enabling and giving access to the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature is disabled by default.
Enable the RBAC plugin and declare policy administrators to start using RBAC features.

The permission policies for users and groups in the {product-short} are managed by permission policy administrators. Only permission policy administrators can access the Role-Based Access Control REST API.

.Prerequisites
* You have {configuring-book-link}[added a custom {product-short} application configuration], and have necessary permissions to modify it.
* You have {authentication-book-link}[enabled an authentication provider].

.Procedure
. The RBAC plugin is installed but disabled by default.
To enable the  `./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-rbac` plugin, edit your `dynamic-plugins.yaml` with the following content.
+
.`dynamic-plugins.yaml` fragment
[source,yaml]
----
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-rbac
    disabled: false
----
+
See {installing-and-viewing-plugins-book-link}[{installing-and-viewing-plugins-book-title}].

. Declare policy administrators to enable a select number of authenticated users to configure RBAC policies through the REST API or Web UI, instead of modifying the CSV file directly.
The permissions can be specified in a separate CSV file referenced in your `{my-app-config-config-map}` config map, or permissions can be created using the REST API or Web UI.
+
To declare users such as _<your_policy_administrator_name>_ as policy administrators, edit your custom {product-short} ConfigMap, such as `app-config-rhdh`, and add following code to the `{my-app-config-file}` content:
+
.`{my-app-config-file}` fragment
[source,yaml,subs=+quotes]
----
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    admin:
      users:
        - name: user:default/__<your_policy_administrator_name>__
----

. In order to display the available permissions provided by installed plugins in the {product-short} UI, you must supply the corresponding list of plugin IDs. There are two ways to do this, by updating your application configuration or by using the RBAC REST API permissions endpoint.
+

.. To provide plugins by updating your application configuration, you can specify the plugins with permissions in your `{my-app-config-file}` file as follows:
+
.`{my-app-config-file}` fragment
[source,yaml,subs=+quotes]
----
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    admin:
      users:
        - name: user:default/__<your_policy_administrator_name>__
    pluginsWithPermission:
      - catalog
      - scaffolder
      - permission
----

.. To specify the plugins with permissions by using the RBAC REST API permissions endpoint, see the xref:rbac-rest-api-permission-endpoints_{context}[RBAC REST API permissions endpoint].

.Verification
. Sign out from the existing {product} session and log in again using the declared policy administrator account.
. With RBAC enabled, most features are disabled by default.
.. Navigate to the *Catalog* page in {product-very-short}.
The *Create* button is not visible.
You cannot create new components.
.. Navigate to the API page.
The *Register* button is not visible.

.Next steps
* Explicitly enable permissions to resources in {product-short}.
