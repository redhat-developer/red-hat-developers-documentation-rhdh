= Policy effect for conflicting permission rules

If conflicting rules exist for the same access request type and the same user role, a _policy effect_ determines the outcome. The {product} policy effect helps ensure high security in two ways:

* The policy effect defaults to `deny` rules when they conflict with `allow` rules. Consider this scenario:
+
.Rule for group_a
[source, Casbin]
---
p, role:default/allow-role, catalog-entity, read, allow
g, group:default/group_a, role:default/allow-role
---
+
.Rule for group_b
[source, Casbin]
---
p, role:default/deny-role, catalog-entity, read, deny
g, group:default/group_b, role:default/deny-role
---
+
If a user belongs to both group_a and group_b, the policy effect denies them access.

* When a basic rule that permits an action conflicts with a conditional rule, the policy effect defaults to the conditional rule.
