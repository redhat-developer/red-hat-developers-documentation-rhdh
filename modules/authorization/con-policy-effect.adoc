= Policy effect

The policy effect determines whether the access request must be approved if multiple policy rules match the request.

.Default policy effect

The default policy effect is deny, meaning that if no rules match the access request, the request is denied.

.Rules with conflicting effects

When one rule permits and the other denies, the deny rule takes precedence, and the policy effect is to deny.

.Consequences for designing policies

When designing policies, it is important to consider the implications of the policy effect. Do not set explicit deny rules unless absolutely necessary, as they can override permit rules and lead to unintended denials of access. Instead, use permit rules to explicitly allow access where needed, and rely on the default deny effect to handle all other cases.
