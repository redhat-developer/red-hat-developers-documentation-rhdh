= Best practices for permission policy design

To prevent unintended access denials, follow these guidelines when designing policies:

* Use `permit` rules to explicitly allow access.
* Rely on the default `deny` effect for all other cases.
* Do not set explicit `deny` rules unless they are required to override existing permit rules.
