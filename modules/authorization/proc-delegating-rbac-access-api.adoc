.Example of creating a new role for the team lead using the RBAC backend API
[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/roles' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "memberReferences": ["user:default/team_lead"],
  "name": "role:default/team_lead",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "This is an example team lead role"

curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '[
  {
    "entityReference": "role:default/team_lead",
    "permission": "policy.entity.create",
    "policy": "create",
    "effect": "allow"
  },
  {
    "entityReference": "role:default/team_lead",
    "permission": "catalog-entity",
    "policy": "read",
    "effect": "allow"
  }
]'
----

. To ensure team leads can only manage what they own, use the `IS_OWNER` conditional rule as follows:
+

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/roles/conditions' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
 "result": "CONDITIONAL",
 "pluginId": "permission",
 "resourceType": "policy-entity",
 "conditions": {
   "rule": "IS_OWNER",
   "resourceType": "policy-entity",
   "params": {
     "owners": [
       "user:default/team_lead"
     ]
   }
 },
 "roleEntityRef": "role:default/team_lead",
 "permissionMapping": [
   "read",
   "update",
   "delete"
 ]
}'
----
The previous example of conditional policy limits visibility and control to only owned roles and policies.
