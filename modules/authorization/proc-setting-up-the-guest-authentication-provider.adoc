= Setting up the guest authentication provider

You can enable guest authentication and use it alongside the RBAC frontend plugin.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the `@janus-idp/backstage-plugin-rbac` plugin in {product-short}. For more information, see link:{plugins-configure-book-url}[{plugins-configure-book-title}].

.Procedure

* In the `{my-app-config-file}` file, add the user entity reference to resolve and enable the `dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment` option, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
auth:
  environment: development
  providers:
    guest:
      userEntityRef: user:default/guest
      dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment: true
----

[NOTE]
====
You can use `user:default/guest` as the user entity reference to match the added user under the `permission.rbac.admin.users` section of the `{my-app-config-file}` file.
