= Enabling transitive parent groups

By default, {product} does not resolve indirect parent groups during authentication.
In this case, with the following group hierarchy, the `user_alice` user is only a member of the `group_developers` group:

----
group_admin
  └── group_developers
    └── user_alice
----

To support multi-level group hierarchies when using the $ownerRefs alias, you can configure {product-short} to include indirect parent groups in the user’s ownership entities.
In that case the `user_alice` user is a member of both `group_developers` and `group_admin` groups.

.Procedure

* Enable the `includeTransitiveGroupOwnership` option in your `{my-app-config-file}` file.
