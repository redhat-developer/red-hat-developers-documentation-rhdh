= Understanding permission policy and role configuration source

You can configure {product} policy and roles by using different sources.
To maintain data consistency, {product-short} associates each permission policy and role with one unique source.
You can only use this source to change the resource.

You can manipulate permission policies and roles based on their source:

Configuration file::
Configure roles and policies in the `app-config.yaml` configuration file, for instance to xref:enabling-and-giving-access-to-rbac[declare your policy administrators].

REST API::
Configure roles and policies xref:managing-authorizations-by-using-the-seb-ui[by using the {product-short} Web UI] or xref:managing-authorizations-by-using-the-rest-api[by using the REST API].

CSV file::
Configure roles and policies by using CSV files.


Legacy::
The legacy source applies to policies and roles defined before RBAC backend plugin version `2.1.3`, and is the least restrictive among the source location options.
+
IMPORTANT: Update the permissions and roles in legacy source to use either REST API or the CSV file sources.

Managing roles and permission policies originating from CSV files and REST API involves straightforward modification based on their initial source information.

The Configuration file pertains to the default `role:default/rbac_admin` role provided by the RBAC plugin.
The default role has limited permissions to create, read, update, and delete permission policies or roles, and to read catalog entities.

[NOTE]
====
In case the default permissions are insufficient for your administrative requirements, you can create a custom admin role with required permission policies.
====

You can use the `GET` requests to query roles and policies and determine the source information, if required.
