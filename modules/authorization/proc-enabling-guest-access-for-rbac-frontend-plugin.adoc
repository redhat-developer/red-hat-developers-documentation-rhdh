= Enabling guest access for the RBAC frontend plugin

Use guest access for the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) frontend plugin to test and develop, except in production. To enable the guest access for the RBAC frontend, configure the backend plugin and set up the guest authentication provider.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the `@janus-idp/backstage-plugin-rbac` plugin in {product-short}. For more information, see link:{plugins-configure-book-url}[{plugins-configure-book-title}].

.Procedure

To configure the RBAC backend plugin, complete the following steps:

Update the `app-config.yaml` file to enable the permission framework as shown:

[source,yaml,subs=+quotes]
----
permission
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    admin:
      users:
        - name: user:default/guest
    pluginsWithPermission:
      - catalog
      - permission
      - scaffolder
----

[NOTE]
====
The `pluginsWithPermission` section of the `app-config.yaml` section includes only three plugins by default. Update the section as needed to include any additional plugins that also incorporate permissions.
====

== Setting up the guest authentication provider

.Procedure

To enable guest authentication and to use it alongside the RBAC frontend plugin, complete the following step:

* In the `app-config.yaml` file, add the user entity reference to resolve and enable the `dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment` option, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
auth:
  environment: development
  providers:
    guest:
      userEntityRef: user:default/guest
      dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment: true
----

[NOTE]
====
You can use `user:default/guest` as the user entity reference to match the added user under the `permission.rbac.admin.users` section of the `app-config.yaml` file.
