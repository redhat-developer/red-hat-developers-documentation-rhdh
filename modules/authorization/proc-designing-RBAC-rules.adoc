= Designing your policy rules

Carefully design your policies to avoid permission conflicts that can result in unintended access denials.

{product} applies policies as follows:

* The default policy is `deny`.
* A conditional rule overrides a basic rule.
* A `deny` basic rule overrides an `allow` basic rule.
* An `allow` conditional rule overrides a `deny` basic rule.
* A `deny` conditional rule overrides an `allow` conditional rule.

.Procedure
. Use `allow` rules to explicitly allow access.
. Avoid creating `deny` rules unless you know precisely how they can affect existing basic `allow` rules and existing conditional rules.
