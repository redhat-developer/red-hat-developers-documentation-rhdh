= Delegating role-based access controls (RBAC) access in {product}

An enterprise customer requires the ability to delegate role-based access control (RBAC) responsibilities to other individuals in the organization. In this scenario, you, as the administrator, can provide access to the RBAC plugin specifically to designated users, such as team leads. Each team lead is then able to manage permissions exclusively for users within their respective team or department, without visibility into or control over permissions outside their assigned scope. This approach allows team leads to manage access and permissions for their own teams independently, while administrators maintain global oversight.

In {product-very-short}, you can delegate RBAC access using the multitenancy feature of RBAC plugin, specifically the `IS_OWNER` conditional rule.

By delegating the RBAC access, you can expect the following outcomes:

* Team leads can manage RBAC settings for their teams independently.
* Visibility of other users' or teams' permissions is restricted.
* Administrators retain overarching control while delegating team-specific access.

.Prerequisites
* Your {product-very-short} instance is up and running with RBAC plugin installed and configured.
* You have administrative access to {product-very-short}.
* You have API access using `curl` or another tool.

.Procedure
. In your {product-very-short} instance, navigate to the *Administration -> RBAC* page.
. Create a new role designated for team leads using the Web UI or API:

.Example of creating a new role for the team lead using the RBAC backend API
[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/roles' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "memberReferences": ["user:default/team_lead"],
  "name": "role:default/team_lead",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "This is an example team lead role"
  }
}'

For more information about creating a role using the Web UI, see xref:proc-rbac-ui-create-role_title-authorization[Creating a role in the {product} Web UI].

. Allow team leads to read catalog entities and create permissions in the RBAC plugin using the Web UI or the following API request:

----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '[
  {
    "entityReference": "role:default/team_lead",
    "permission": "policy.entity.create",
    "policy": "create",
    "effect": "allow"
  },
  {
    "entityReference": "role:default/team_lead",
    "permission": "catalog-entity",
    "policy": "read",
    "effect": "allow"
  }
]'
----

. To ensure team leads can only manage what they own, use the `IS_OWNER` conditional rule as follows:
+

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/roles/conditions' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
 "result": "CONDITIONAL",
 "pluginId": "permission",
 "resourceType": "policy-entity",
 "conditions": {
   "rule": "IS_OWNER",
   "resourceType": "policy-entity",
   "params": {
     "owners": [
       "user:default/team_lead"
     ]
   }
 },
 "roleEntityRef": "role:default/team_lead",
 "permissionMapping": [
   "read",
   "update",
   "delete"
 ]
}'
----
The previous example of conditional policy limits visibility and control to only owned roles and policies.

. Log in to {product-very-short} as team lead and verify the following:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/roles' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TEAM_LEAD_TOKEN"

.. Use the following request to create a new role for their team:

  }
}'

[NOTE]
====
You can set the ownership during creation, but you can also update the ownership at any time.

    "permission": "catalog-entity",
    "policy": "read",
    "effect": "allow"
  }

----

.. Use the following request to verify that only team-owned roles and policies are visible:

curl -X GET 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/roles' \

curl -X GET 'http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TEAM_LEAD_TOKEN"

.Verification
* Log in as a team lead and verify the following:
+
--
** The RBAC UI is accessible.
** Only the assigned users or group is visible.
** Permissions outside the scoped team are not viewable or editable.
--
* Log in as an administrator and verify that you retain full visibility and control.
