= Supported architecture for Orchestrator

You can use Orchestrator to design, run, and monitor workflows that automate key tasks. It builds on components like SonataFlow and OpenShift Serverless, which provide the runtime environment and event-driven capabilities needed to power your workflows.

To help you get started quickly, the following Orchestrator plugin components are included but disabled by default in the `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` file:

* `"backstage-plugin-orchestrator"`
* `"backstage-plugin-orchestrator-backend-dynamic"`
* `"backstage-plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-orchestrator-dynamic"`
* `"backstage-plugin-orchestrator-form-widgets"`

To enable these plugins, set the `plugins.disabled` parameter to `false`.
