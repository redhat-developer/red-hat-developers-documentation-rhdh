= Orchestrator plugin components on {ocp-short}

To run the Orchestrator plugin successfully on {ocp-short}, you must first install the following required components:

** {product} ({product-very-short}) {product-custom-resource-type}
** OpenShift Serverless Logic Operator
** OpenShift Serverless Operator
*** Knative Serving
*** Knative Eventing
** (Optional) For managing the Orchestrator project, you need a preinstalled instance of Argo CD or {company-name} OpenShift GitOps in the cluster. It is disabled by default.
** (Optional) To use Tekton tasks and the build pipeline, you need a preinstalled instance of Tekton or {company-name} OpenShift Pipelines in the cluster. These features are disabled by default.

The most recommended approach to install the dependencies for the Orchestrator plugin is by enabling the dependencies for the Orchestrator plugin directly during your {product-very-short} installation. When you configure {product-very-short} to include the Orchestrator plugin, the {product-very-short} Operator installs the necessary OpenShift Serverless operators, eliminating the need for separate scripts or Helm charts.

For specific use cases, you can choose to install the dependencies manually or use helper utilities.
