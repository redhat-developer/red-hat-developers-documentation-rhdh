= Installing components for the Orchestrator plugin on {ocp-short}

To run the Orchestrator plugin successfully on {ocp-short}, you must first install the required dependencies. The Orchestrator plugin depends on the following components:

** {product} ({product-very-short}) {product-custom-resource-type}
** OpenShift Serverless Logic Operator
** OpenShift Serverless Operator
*** Knative Serving
*** Knative Eventing
** (Optional) An ArgoCD project named orchestrator requires a pre-installed ArgoCD or {company-name} OpenShift GitOps instance in the cluster. It is disabled by default.
** (Optional) Tekton tasks and build pipeline. These require a pre-installed Tekton or {company-name} OpenShift Pipelines instance in the cluster, and are disabled by default.

The most recommended approach to installing the dependencies for the Orchestrator plugin is by enabling the Orchestrator plugin's dependencies directly during your {product-very-short} installation. When you configure {product-very-short} to include the Orchestrator plugin, the {product-very-short} operator installs the necessary OpenShift Serverless operators, eliminating the need for separate scripts or Helm charts.

For specific use cases, you can choose to install the dependencies manually or use helper utilities.
