= Why build workflow images?

While the OpenShift Serverless Logic Operator supports the building of workflows dynamically, this approach is primarily for experimentation.
For production deployments, building images is the preferred method due to the following reasons:

Production readiness:: Prebuilt images can be scanned, secured, and tested before going live.
GitOps compatibility:: The Orchestrator relies on a central OpenShift Serverless Logic Operator instance to track workflows and their state. To use this tracking service, you must deploy workflows with the `gitops` profile, which expects a prebuilt image.
Testing and quality:: Building an image gives you more control over the testing process.
