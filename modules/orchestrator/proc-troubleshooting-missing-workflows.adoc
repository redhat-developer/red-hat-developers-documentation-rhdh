[id="proc-troubleshooting-missing-workflows_{context}"]
= Troubleshooting workflows missing from the {product-very-short} UI

As an administrator, perform the following checks to verify the workflow status and connectivity if a deployed workflow does not appear in the Orchestrator plugin interface.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the OpenShift cluster where {product-very-short} and SonataFlow services are running.
* You have verified the GitOps profile: Make sure the workflow definition and SonataFlow manifests use the `gitops` profile. The {product-very-short} Orchestrator UI displays only workflows that use this profile.

.Procedure

. **Check workflow pod readiness:** Verify the workflow successfully registers with the Data Index service before it becomes ready.
+
----
oc get pods <workflow_pod_name>
----
. **If the pod is not ready, check for connection errors:**
+
----
oc logs <workflow_pod_name>
----
. **If the log shows `Connection refused: sonataflow-platform-data-index-service`, ensure the Data Index service is running:**
+
.If you use a cluster-wide platform, check the `sonataflow-infra` namespace:
+
----
oc get pods -l sonataflow.org/service=sonataflow-platform-data-index-service -n sonataflow-infra
----
+
.If the Data Index is running, restart the workflow:
+
----
oc rollout restart deployment <workflow_name>
----
. **Verify connectivity from the workflow to the Data Index:** Access the workflow pod and attempt to query the Data Index GraphQL endpoint.
+
----
curl -g -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"query":"query{ ProcessDefinitions { id, serviceUrl, endpoint } }"}' \
http://sonataflow-platform-data-index-service.sonataflow-infra/graphql
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Adjust the service name and namespace (`sonataflow-infra`) to match your deployment.
====

.Verification

. Access the {product-very-short} pod and verify it reaches the workflow management endpoint.
+
----
curl http://<workflow_host>/management/processes
----
. Check the {product-very-short} logs for the orchestrator plugin activity.
+
----
{"level":"info","message":"fetchWorkflowInfos() called...","plugin":"orchestrator"...}
----
. Check the `<workflow_name>-managed-props` ConfigMap to ensure the Data Index URLs are correct.

. Check the database registration. Access the PostgreSQL pod used by the Data Index and verify the workflow is registered in the `definitions` table.
+
----
PGPASSWORD=<password> psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U <user> -d sonataflow
sonataflow=# SET search_path TO "sonataflow-platform-data-index-service";
sonataflow=# select id, name from definitions;
----
. Verify Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions. If the workflow is registered but remains hidden, set the {product-very-short} log level to `DEBUG` to identify RBAC denials.
