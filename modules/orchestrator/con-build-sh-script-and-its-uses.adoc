= The `build-sh` script functionality and important flags

The `build-sh` script does the following tasks in order:

* Generates workflow manifests using the `kn-workflow` CLI.
* Builds the workflow image using `podman` or `docker`.
* Optional: The script pushes the images to an image registry and deploys the workflow using `kubectl`.

You can review the script configuration options and see available flags and their functions by accessing the help menu:

[source,bash]
----
./scripts/build.sh [flags]

The following flags are essential for running the script:
