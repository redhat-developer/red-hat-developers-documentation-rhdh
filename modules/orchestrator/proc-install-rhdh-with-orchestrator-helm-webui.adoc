= Install {product} ({product-very-short}) using Helm from the {ocp-short} web console

You can install {product} ({product-very-short}) with the Orchestrator by using the ({ocp-short}) web console. This method is useful if you prefer a graphical interface or want to deploy cluster-wide resources without using the Helm CLI.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {ocp-short} web console as an administrator.
* You have access to the {product} Helm chart repository.
* Your cluster has internet access or the Helm charts are mirrored in a disconnected environment.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp-short} web console, go to the Helm Charts and verify that the {product} Helm chart repository is available.

. Search for the Orchestrator infrastructure for {product} and select *Install*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must be an administrator to install the Orchestrator Infrastructure for {product} Helm chart because it deploys cluster-scoped resources. As an administrator, you must manually approve the install plans for OpenShift Serverless and Serverless Logic Operators.
====
+
As a regular user, search for the {product} chart and install it by setting the value of `orchestrator.enabled` to `true`. Otherwise, the Orchestrator will not be deployed.

. Wait until they are successfully deployed.

. Monitor the deployment status by navigating to *Pods* or releases.

.Verification

After deployment completes:

* The orchestrator-related pods are running in the selected namespace.
* Cluster-wide resources are present.
* You can start connecting the orchestrator to your {product} UI.
