= Enabling Orchestrator plugins components

To use the Orchestrator, enable the following Orchestrator plugins for {product}, that are disabled by default:

Orchestrator-frontend plugin::

`backstage-plugin-orchestrator`:::
Provides the interface for users to run and monitor workflows within {product-very-short}. You can run and track the execution status of processes.

Orchestrator-backend plugin::

`backstage-plugin-orchestrator-backend`:::
Gets workflow data into {product-short} making sure {product-very-short} processes critical workflow metadata and runtime status fulfilling your need for visibility.

Orchestrator-form-widget::

`backstage-plugin-orchestrator-form-widgets`:::
Provides custom widgets for the workflow execution form, allowing you to customize input fields and streamline the process of launching workflows.

Orchestrator-scaffolder-backend-module::

`scaffolder-backend-module-orchestrator`:::
Provides callable actions from Scaffolder templates, such as `orchestrator:workflow:run` or `orchestrator:workflow:get_params`.
