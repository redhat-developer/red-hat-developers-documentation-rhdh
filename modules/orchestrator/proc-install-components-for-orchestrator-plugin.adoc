= Installing the components for the Orchestrator plugin on {ocp-short}

To run the Orchestrator plugin successfully on {ocp-short}, you must install components that provide the runtime environment and the dependencies that the plugin requires.

.Prerequisites

* To install the Orchestrator plugin on {ocp-short}, you require the following components installed:

** OpenShift Serverless Operator
** Knative Serving
** Knative Eventing
** OpenShift Serverless Logic Operator
+
[NOTE]
====
You must preinstall the components, or install them by using one of the supported methods described below (manual installation, helper script, or Helm chart).
====

.Procedure

To install components (Operators) that provide the dependencies required by the Orchestrator plugin on {ocp-short}, use the following methods:

* Manual installation
* {product-very-short} helper script
* {product-very-short} Orchestrator Infra Helm Chart
+
These components enable the creation of the `SonataFlowPlatform` custom resource and several supporting `NetworkPolicy` resources.

.Manual installation

Use manual installation for production environments. Choose this method when you have installed the required components versions, such as when other applications are using OpenShift Serverless.

For more information on preparing the required infrastructure, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_serverless/1.36[Red Hat OpenShift Serverless] to do the following:

* Prepare for OpenShift Serverless installation

* Install the OpenShift Serverless Operator

* Install Knative Serving

* Install Knative Eventing

* Install the OpenShift Serverless Logic Operator

.{product-very-short} helper script
You can install the OpenShift Serverless infrastructure for the Orchestrator plugin using the {product-very-short} helper script. You can use the script in empty clusters.

For more information on controlling the installation of the Operators, see link:https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/tasks/install-operator-with-olm/[Install your Operator with OLM].

WARNING: Use the {product-very-short} helper script for a quick-start on an empty cluster. Do not use it in production.

.Procedure
. Download the `plugin-infra.sh` script as shown in the following example:
+
[code,terminal]
----
curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/refs/heads/release-${PRODUCT_VERSION}/config/profile/rhdh/plugin-infra/plugin-infra.sh # Specify the {product} version in the URL or use main
----
. Run the script as shown in the following example:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ ./plugin-infra.sh
----

.{product-very-short} Orchestrator Infra Helm Chart
You can use {product-very-short} Orchestrator Infra Helm Chart to install components for the Orchestrator plugins in empty clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Orchestrator Infra Helm chart is suitable for production use. By default, it does *not* auto-install or auto-upgrade Operators: you must approve the install plans.
