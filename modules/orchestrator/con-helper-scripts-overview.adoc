= Helper scripts overview for the Orchestrator on {ocp-short}

You can install the OpenShift Serverless infrastructure for the Orchestrator plugin using the {product-very-short} helper script. The following helper scripts are available to streamline non-production setup:

* `setup.sh`: Initializes the {product-very-short} environment by creating the required authentication secret and labeling GitOps namespaces based on cluster configuration. It can use defaults or prompt for values.
* `plugin-infra.sh`: Installs the OpenShift Serverless infrastructure required by the Orchestrator plugin.

[NOTE]
====
These scripts are intended for quick-start scenarios and are **not recommended for production**.
