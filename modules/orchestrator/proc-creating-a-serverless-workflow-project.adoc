= Creating a serverless workflow project

Use the Orchestrator software templates to generate a project that includes workflow definitions, `Kustomize` configurations, and CI/CD pipelines.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed `orchestrator-software-templates-infra` and `orchestrator-software-templates` Helm charts to enable templates.

* You have installed {product-very-short} and the Orchestrator plugin by using the Helm chart.

* You have a `Quay.io` organization and repository for storing the workflow images.

* You have a GitHub or Gitlab personal access token with repository creation permissions.

* You have configured a GitOps secret for the target cluster.

* You have set the target namespace for both the pipeline and the workflow to the `rhdh` namespace.

.Procedure

. Prepare the image registry. Before creating the template, configure the target repository in `Quay.io`.

.. Log in to your `Quay.io` organization (for example, `orchestrator-testing`).

.. Create a new repository (for example, `serverless-workflow-demo`).

.. Add robot account permissions to the repository settings.

. Open the {product} Catalog.

. Select the *Basic workflow bootstrap project* template and click *Launch Template*.

. Follow the template form to enter required details, including the *GitHub organization*, *source code repository name*, and a unique *Workflow ID*.

. For the CI/CD method, select *Tekton with Argo CD* to generate GitOps resources.

. Set the *Workflow Namespace* to `rhdh` and the *GitOps Namespace* to `orchestrator-gitops`.

. Enter your `Quay.io` registry details.

. Click *Review*, then click *Create*.

. Optional: Enable persistence and provide database connection details if the workflow requires a database schema.

.Verification

* The system creates the following repositories:

** Source code repository: Contains the serverless workflow project.
** GitOps repository: Contains GitOps configurations, Tekton pipeline templates, and bootstrap instructions.
