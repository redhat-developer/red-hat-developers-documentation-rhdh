= Creating and running your serverless workflow project locally

The `kn-workflow` CLI is an essential tool that generates workflow manifests and project structures. To ensure successful development and immediate testing, begin developing a new serverless workflow locally by completing the following steps:

.Procedure
. Use the `kn-workflow` CLI to create a new workflow project, which adheres to the Quarkus structure as shown in the following example:
+
[source,bash]
----
kn-workflow quarkus create --name <specify project name, for example ,00_new_project>
----

. Edit the workflow, add schema and specific files, and run it locally from project folder as shown in the following example:
+
[source,bash]
----
kn-workflow quarkus run
----
. Run the workflow locally using the `kn-workflow run` which pulls the following image:
+
[source,yaml]
----
registry.redhat.io/openshift-serverless-1/logic-swf-devmode-rhel8:1.36.0
----

. For building the workflow image, the `kn-workflow` CLI pulls the following images:
+
[source,yaml]
----
registry.redhat.io/openshift-serverless-1/logic-swf-builder-rhel8:1.36.0-8
registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-17:1.21-2
----
