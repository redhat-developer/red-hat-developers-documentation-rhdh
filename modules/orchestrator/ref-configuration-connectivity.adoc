= Configuration and connectivity issues

Issues with namespace isolation and database initialization can prevent SonataFlow services from starting correctly.

Workflow fails to start in a different namespace When you deploy a workflow in a namespace different from the SonataFlow services (for example, outside sonataflow-infra), you must configure specific network policies and persistence settings. Ensure that the workflow can reach the sonataflow-platform-data-index-service.

Data Index cannot connect to the database If the sonataflow-platform-data-index-service pods fail to connect to the database on startup:
• Check Pod Status: Ensure the PostgreSQL pod has fully initialized. The Data Index and Job Service pods cannot connect until the database is fully operational.
• Check Network Policies: If the PostgreSQL server is in a different namespace than the SonataFlow services, verify that network policies allow ingress traffic from the SonataFlow services namespace (for example, sonataflow-infra).
