= Installing {product} ({product-very-short}) on {ocp-short} with the Orchestrator using the Helm CLI

You can install {product} ({product-very-short}) on {ocp-short} with the Orchestrator by using the Helm CLI. The installation automatically enables the required dynamic plugins and integrates workflow infrastructure.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in as an administrator and have access to the {product} Helm chart repository.
* You can install the necessary infrastructures resources, such as SonataFlow, alongside {product-very-short} in the same namespace.
+
This is a one-off requirement and must be completed before enabling the Orchestrator plugin.

.Procedure

. As an administrator, install relevant cluster-wide resources.
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
helm repo add openshift-helm-charts https://charts.openshift.io/
helm install `<release_name>` openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub-orchestrator-infra
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must be an administrator to install the `redhat-developer-hub-orchestrator-infra` Helm chart because it deploys additional cluster-scoped OpenShift Serverless and OpenShift Serverless Logic Operators. As an administrator, you need to manually approve the install plans for OpenShift Serverless and Serverless Logic Operators.
====

. Install the Backstage chart with the orchestrator enabled as shown in the following example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ helm install <release_name> openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub --version {product-chart-version} \
  --set orchestrator.enabled=true
----

. (Optional) Enable *Notifications* and *Signals* plugins by adding them to the `global.dynamic.plugins` list in your `values.yaml` file as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
global:
  dynamic:
    plugins:
      - disabled: false
        package: "./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-notifications"
      - disabled: false
        package: "./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-signals"
      - disabled: false
        package: "./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-notifications-backend-dynamic"
      - disabled: false
        package: "./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-signals-backend-dynamic"
----

. (Optional) You can disable the Serverless Logic and Serverless Operators individually or together by setting their values to `false`, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
helm install <release_name> openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub \
  --version {product-chart-version} \
  --set orchestrator.enabled=true \
  --set orchestrator.serverlessOperator=false \
  --set orchestrator.serverlessLogicOperator=false
----

. (Optional) If you are using an external database, add the following configuration under `orchestrator.sonataflowPlatform` in your `values.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
orchestrator:
  sonataflowPlatform:
    externalDBsecretRef: "<cred-secret>"
    externalDBName: "<database_name>" # The name of the user-configured existing database (Not the database that the orchestrator and sonataflow resources use).
    externalDBHost: "<database_host>"
    externalDBPort: "<database_port>"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This step only configures the Orchestrators use of an external database. To configure {product} to use an external PostgreSQL instance, follow the steps in {configuring-book-link}#proc-configuring-postgresql-instance-using-helm_configuring-external-postgresql-databases[Configuring a PostgreSQL instance using Helm].
====

.Verification

. Verify that the Orchestrator plugin is visible in the {product} UI.

. Create and run sample workflows to confirm the orchestration is functioning correctly.
