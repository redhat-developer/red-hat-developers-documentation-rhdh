= Understanding Orchestrator plugin dependencies for Operator installation

The Orchestrator plugin in {product-very-short} requires components such as SonataFlow and supporting network policies to run. When you enable the plugin in your {product-custom-resource-type} custom resource (CR), the Operator automatically provisions these dependencies for you:

* A `SonataflowPlatform` CR
* `NetworkPolicies` that allow traffic between infrastructure resources (Knative, Serverless Logic Operator), monitoring traffic, and intra-namespace traffic

The `orchestrator-backend` plugin uses the `sonataflow-platform-data-index-service`, which the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR creates to communicate with the SonataFlow platform.

The Operator resolves the dependency reference SonataFlow against the `sonataflow.yaml` manifest included in its profile configuration (`config/profile/rhdh/plugin-deps/sonataflow.yaml`) and applies it to create the required resources.

The Operator automatically applies the `sonataflow.yaml` manifest, creating the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR and required `NetworkPolicy` resources in the {product-custom-resource-type} CR namespace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `SonataFlowPlatform` CR contains Data Index service that requires PostgreSQL database as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
      persistence:
        postgresql:
          secretRef:
            name: backstage-psql-secret-{{backstage-name}}
            userKey: POSTGRES_USER
            passwordKey: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
          serviceRef:
            name: backstage-psql-{{backstage-name}} # # Namespace where the {product-custom-resource-type} CR is created
            namespace: {{backstage-ns}} # Namespace where the {product-custom-resource-type} (CR) is created
            databaseName: backstage_plugin_orchestrator
----
====

By default, the Orchestrator plugin dependencies use the following:

* The PostgreSQL database named `backstage_plugin_orchestrator` created by {product-custom-resource-type}
* A Secret created by {product-custom-resource-type} Operator for the PostgreSQL with `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` keys as the database credentials in the {product-custom-resource-type} CR namespace.
* A Service created by {product-custom-resource-type} Operator for the PostgreSQL database with the name `backstage-psql-{{backstage-name}}` in the {product-custom-resource-type} CR namespace.

For more information about automatic plugin dependency creation when the {product-custom-resource-type} CR is applied to the cluster, see link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/blob/release-1.7/docs/dynamic-plugins.md#dynamic-plugins-dependency-management[Dynamic plugins dependency management].

[NOTE]
====
To enable the {product-custom-resource-type} Operator to work with the SonataFlow platform, its `ServiceAccount` must have the appropriate permissions.

The Operator automatically creates the required Role and _RoleBinding_ resource in `profile/rhdh/plugin-rbac` directory.
