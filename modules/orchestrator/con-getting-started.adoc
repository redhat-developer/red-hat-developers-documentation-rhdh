= Getting started with Orchestrator

To start using Orchestrator in {product-very-short}, you must:

* Install the required infrastructure components, such as OpenShift Serverless Operator, and OpenShift Serverless Logic Operator

* Configure your {product-custom-resource-type} custom resource (CR) or Helm values file for Orchestrator

[NOTE]
====
When using the {product-very-short} Operator, you must first install the required infrastructure components. The Operator then provisions the dependent SonataFlow resources once the Orchestrator plugins are enabled in the {product-custom-resource-type} CR.

When using the {product-very-short} Helm chart, the required infrastructure components are installed automatically using the dedicated `redhat-developer-hub-orchestrator-infra` Helm chart prior to enabling the Orchestrator plugins in the main {product-very-short} chart.
