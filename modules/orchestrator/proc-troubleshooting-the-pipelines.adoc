= Troubleshooting the CI/CD pipeline

Deployment failures involve plugin visibility, running pipeline, or resource synchronization.

. Visibility issues

Missing Orchestrator plugin:: If Orchestrator features do not appear in {product-very-short}, make sure you have updated the {product-very-short} Helm chart with the required plugins.

Software templates not appearing:: Make sure the `orchestrator-software-templates` chart is installed and the `orchestrator-auth-secret` exists in the correct namespace.

. Pipeline failure (CI)

GitHub or GitLab actions failure:: The GitOps automation includes a GitHub Action or GitLab CI step that creates a `PipelineRun` manifest from a `PipelineRun` template. This step might fail due to invalid Git credentials, lack of sufficient GitLab workers, or misconfiguration.
+
Therefore, examine the failed GitHub or GitLab actions or create the `PipelineRun` file manually.

Build or push issues:: Check the *CI* tab in the {product-very-short} Catalog.
+
If the status does not bubble up to {product-very-short}, use the {ocp-short} console to monitor pipeline instances and triggered jobs. For detailed logs, navigate to *Pipelines* > *PipelineRuns* in the {ocp-short} console.
+
If the Tekton pipeline fails during the build or push stages:

* Verify that your `Quay.io` robot account has Write permissions.

* Make sure the `docker-registry-credentials` secret is present in the `rhdh` namespace.

. Resource visibility and Sync issues (CD)

Pipeline succeeds but workflows are missing:: If the CI pipeline succeeds but the workflow does not appear in the *CD* tab:

* Make sure the target namespace is labeled for ArgoCD:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label ns sonataflow-infra rhdh.redhat.com/argocd-namespace=true
----

* Make sure the ArgoCD ServiceAccount has the required permissions to manage resources in the `rhdh` namespace.

ArgoCD sync failure:: If resources appear but stay in an `OutOfSync` state, click *Refresh* in the ArgoCD UI or make sure the *AppProject* exists in the `orchestrator-gitops` namespace.
