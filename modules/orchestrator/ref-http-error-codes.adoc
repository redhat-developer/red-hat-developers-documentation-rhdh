= HTTP error codes in workflows

Workflow operations transmit REST requests to REST endpoints. If a REST endpoint returns an HTTP error, the workflow stops immediately. The system displays the HTTP code and the related error message. Use the HTTP code and message to diagnose the failure.

The following table describes common HTTP errors encountered during workflow execution:
