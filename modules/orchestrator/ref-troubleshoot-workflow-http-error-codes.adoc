= Troubleshoot workflow HTTP error codes

Workflow operations send REST requests to service endpoints. When an endpoint returns an HTTP error, the workflow fails. The user interface displays the HTTP code and the error message. You can use this information to diagnose the failure. Refer to link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status[HTTP code documentation] to understand the meaning of specific errors.

The following table lists common HTTP errors encountered during workflow deployments:
