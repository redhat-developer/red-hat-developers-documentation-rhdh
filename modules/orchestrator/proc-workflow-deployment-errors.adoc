= Troubleshooting common workflow deployment errors

Use these steps to diagnose and resolve common workflow deployment, connectivity, or configuration failures.

.Procedure

. If the workflow operation fails, examine the container log of the specific workflow instance to determine the cause by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs my-workflow-xy73lj
----

. If the workflow fails to reach an HTTPS endpoint, check the pod log for an SSL certificate verification failure. This occurs if the target endpoint uses a Certificate Authority (CA) that the workflow cannot verify. The resulting error resembles the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException - unable to find valid certification path to requested target
----

. To resolve the SSL certificate error, load the additional CA certificate into the running workflow container.
