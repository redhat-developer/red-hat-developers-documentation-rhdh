= Verifying the deployment

Verify the status of your continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines in the {product-very-short} component catalog.

.Procedure
. For CI:

.. In the {product-very-short} Catalog, select your source code repository component (for example, `onboardings`).

.. Click the *CI* tab and verify that the pipeline run status is *Succeeded*.

.. If the pipeline status does not appear in the {product} console, verify the CI status directly in your Git provider (GitHub or GitLab).

.. If the pipeline fails, click the *run* name to view the logs and identify build errors.

. For CD:
.. Open the GitOps Resources Repository component in the Catalog (for example, `onboarding-gitops`).

.. Click the *CD* tab and make sure the Kubernetes resources are synced and healthy. This confirms that ArgoCD deployed the workflow to the cluster.
