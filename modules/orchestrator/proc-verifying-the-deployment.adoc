After bootstrapping the GitOps resources, verify the status of the pipelines in the {product-very-short} component catalog.

.Verifying the CI pipeline

.. Open the Source Code Repository component in the {product-very-short} Catalog (for example, `onboardings`).

.. Click the *CI* tab and make sure the pipeline run shows a status is `Succeeded`. This confirms that the image was built and pushed to the Quay registry.

.. If the pipeline failed, click the *run* name to view the logs and identify build errors.

.Verifying the CD pipeline

.. Open the GitOps Resources Repository component in the Catalog (for example, `onboarding-gitops`).

.. Click the *CD* tab and make sure the Kubernetes resources are synced and healthy. This confirms that ArgoCD deployed the workflow to the cluster.
