= Building the `01_basic` workflow

To run the script from the root directory of the repository, you must use the `-w` flag to point to the workflow directory. Additionally, specify the output directory with the `-m` flag.

.Prerequisites

* You have specified the target image using a tag.

.Procedure

. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
./scripts/build.sh --image=quay.io/orchestrator/demo-basic:test -w 01_basic/ -m 01_basic/manifests
----
+
This build command produces the following two artifacts:

* A workflow image and Kubernetes manifests: `quay.io/orchestrator/demo-basic:test` and tagged as `latest`.
* Kubernetes manifests under: `01_basic/manifests/`

. Optional: You can add the `--push` flag to automatically push the image after building. Otherwise, pushing manually is mandatory before deploying.
