= Orchestrator plugin permissions

The Orchestrator plugin uses the {product} permission mechanism and the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) plugin to restrict access to backend endpoints. Orchestrator supports decoupling visibility (read) from running (update) using specific workflow IDs instead of generic permissions.

[WARNING]
====
Generic permissions override specific denial policies within the same action type. To maintain granular control, avoid granting generic permissions if you intend to restrict specific workflows.

* Granting `orchestrator.workflow` (read) prevents you from denying access to `orchestrator.workflow.[workflowId]` (read).
* Granting `orchestrator.workflow.use` (update) prevents you from denying access to `orchestrator.workflow.use.[workflowId]` (update).
====

The [`workflowId`] must match the unique identifier in your workflow definition file. For example, in the workflow definition below, the identifier is `greeting`:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
id: greeting
version: '1.0'
specVersion: '0.8'

description: YAML based greeting workflow
