= Orchestrator plugin permissions

The Orchestrator plugin uses the {product} permission mechanism and the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) plugin to restrict access to backend endpoints.
Orchestrator supports decoupling visibility (read) from running (update) using specific workflow IDs instead of generic permissions as shown in the following table:

[cols="15%,15%,15,55%", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
|Permission name|Resource Type|Policy|Description

|orchestrator.workflow
|named resource
|read
|List and read _all_ workflow definitions

List and read their instances

|orchestrator.workflow.[`workflowId`]
|named resource
|read
|List and read a _single_ workflow definition

List and read instances created for this particular workflow.

|orchestrator.workflow.use
|named resource
|update
|Run or abort _any_ workflow

|orchestrator.workflow.use.[`workflowId`]
|named resource
|update
|Run or abort a _specific_ workflow

|orchestrator.workflowAdminView
|named resource
|read
|View instance variables and workflow definition editor

|orchestrator.instanceAdminView
|named resource
|read
|View _all_ workflow instances, including those created by other users.
|===

[WARNING]
====
Avoid generic permissions for specific control. The system grants access if either a generic permission or a specific one provides it. Granting generic permissions overrides specific denial policies within the same action type:
- Granting orchestrator.workflow (read) prevents you from denying access to orchestrator.workflow.[workflowId] (read).
- Granting orchestrator.workflow.use (update) prevents you from denying access to orchestrator.workflow.use.[workflowId] (update).
====

The [`workflowId`] must match the unique identifier in your workflow definition file. For example,
in the workflow definition below, the identifier is `greeting`:

[source,subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
id: greeting
version: '1.0'
specVersion: '0.8'
name: Greeting workflow
description: YAML based greeting workflow
