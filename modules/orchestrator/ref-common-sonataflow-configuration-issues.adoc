= Common SonataFlow configuration issues

The following are common configuration problems encountered during SonataFlow deployment and direct solutions for verifying persistence and connectivity:

. Workflow installed in a separate namespace than Sonataflow services fails to start.
+
You can deploy a workflow to a namespace outside the core SonataFlow services (for example, `sonataflow-infra`). Use the following steps to enable persistence and connectivity for the workflow:

Configure network policies for inter-namespace traffic::

* Allow core SonataFlow services to receive traffic from the workflow namespace by creating a new `NetworkPolicy` or updating the existing one to include the new namespace.

* Set up a separate `NetworkPolicy` in the workflow namespace to control communication, allowing traffic only between {product-very-short}, Knative, SonataFlow services, and workflows.

* Optionally, create an `allow-intra-namespace` policy in the workflow namespace to enable unrestricted communication among all pods within that namespace.

Ensure workflow persistence (If required)::

* Create a dedicated PostgreSQL Secret containing database credentials within the workflow namespace.

* Configure the workflow `serviceRef` property to correctly reference the PostgreSQL service namespace using the `namespace: $POSTGRESQL_NAMESPACE` attribute.

Identify required namespaces::

* Retrieve the namespace value where {product-very-short} is running using `oc get backstage -A`.

* Identify the SonataFlow Services Namespace by checking for either a `sonataflowclusterplatform` or `sonataflowplatform` instance.

. `sonataflow-platform-data-index-service` cannot connect to PostgreSQL database on startup.
+
Diagnose database connection failures by performing the following checks:

.. Make sure the PostgreSQL Pod has fully transitioned to a `running` and operational status.
+
Allow additional time for the database initialization before expecting related service pods (`DataIndex`, `JobService`) to establish a connection.

.. If the PostgreSQL Server operates in a dedicated namespace (for example, outside `sonataflow-infra`), configure network policies to ingress from the SonataFlow services namespace. Network policies might prevent the DataIndex and JobService pods from connecting to the database.
