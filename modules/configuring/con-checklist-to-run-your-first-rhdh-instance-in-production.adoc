[id="checklist-to-run-your-first-rhdh-instance-in-production_{context}"]
= Checklist to run your first {product} ({product-very-short}) instance in production.

With the default configuration, {product-short} runs with a minimal feature set that does not require secure connection to external services such as an identity provider, a Git provider, and external PostgreSQL and Redis databases.

Using critical features therefore requires following additional configuration:

For resiliency::
* Use an external PostgreSQL database.
* Enable high-availability.

For performance::
* Enable assets caching to an external Redis database.

For security::
* Use secure connections to your external services.
* Provision users and enable authentication.
* Enable role-based access control, and configure the permission policy by using the Web UI.

For adapting to your environment::
* Enable GitHub repository discovery.
* Customize {product-short} appearance with your logo.
