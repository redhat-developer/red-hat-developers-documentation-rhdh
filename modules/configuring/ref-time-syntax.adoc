[WARNING]
====
{product-very-short} configuration reader `readDurationFromConfig` explicitly **disallows** plain numbers to prevent ambiguity.

However, specific raw configuration fields, such as direct Node.js HTTP server settings, might strictly require numbers. Always check the specific documentation for the field you are configuring.
