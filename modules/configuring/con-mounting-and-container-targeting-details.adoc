= Mounting and Container Targeting Details

The mounting behavior is determined by the combination of the optional `key` and `mountPath` fields. Use the `containers` field (available since `v1alpha4`/`v0.8`) to specify targets other than the default container.

.Container targeting options
|===
| Configuration | Target Containers

| No or empty `containers` field
| Only the **`backstage-backend`** container (default).

| `containers: ["*"]`
| **All** containers in the Pod.

| Explicit container names
| Only the containers listed (e.g., `backstage-backend`, `install-dynamic-plugins`).
|===

.File mounting behavior

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Configuration | Mounting Behavior | Watch/Update Status

| Nothing specified
| Each key/value mounts as filename/content with `subPath`.
| Resources are watched by the Operator and the Pod is refreshed on change.

| `key` specified (with or without `mountPath`)
| The specified key/value mounts with `subPath`.
| Resources are watched by the Operator.

| Only `mountPath` specified
| A directory containing all key/values mounts without `subPath`.
| Related resources are typically auto-updated by Kubernetes.

[NOTE]
====
For security reasons, mounting files from **Secrets** is not supported if both `mountPath` and `key` are unspecified.
