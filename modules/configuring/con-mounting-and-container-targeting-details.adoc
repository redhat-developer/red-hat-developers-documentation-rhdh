= Mounting and Container Targeting Details

The mounting behavior is determined by the combination of the optional `key` and `mountPath` fields. Use the `containers` field (available since `v1alpha4`/`v1.8`) to specify targets other than the default container.

.Container targeting options
|===
| Configuration | Target Containers

| No or empty `containers` field
| Only the `backstage-backend` container (default).

| `containers: ["*"]`
| All containers in the Pod.

| Explicit container names
| Only the containers listed (for example, `backstage-backend`, `install-dynamic-plugins`).
