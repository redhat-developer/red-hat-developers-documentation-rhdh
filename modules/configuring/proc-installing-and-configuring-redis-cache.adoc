[id="proc-installing-and-configuring-redis-cache_{context}"]
= Configuring the Redis cache for dynamic plugins in {product}.

By default {product} does not cache plugin assets.
You can use a Redis cache store to improve {product-very-short} performance and reliability.
Configured plugins in {product-very-short} receive dedicated cache connections, which are powered by the Keyv redis client.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed Red Hat Developer Hub by using either the Operator or Helm chart.
* You have an active Redis server. For more information on setting up an external Redis server, see the link:https://www.redis.io/docs/latest/[`Redis official documentation`].

.Procedure
. Enable the {product-short} cache by defining Redis as the store type and entering your Redis server connection URL in your `{my-app-config-file}` file:
+
.`{my-app-config-file}` file fragment
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
backend:
  cache:
    store: redis
    connection: redis://user:pass@cache.example.com:6379
----

. To enable the Redis cache for Techdocs, add the `techdocs.cache.ttl` setting in your `{my-app-config-file}` file.  This setting specifies how long, in milliseconds, a statically built asset should stay in the Redis cache.
+
.`{my-app-config-file}` file fragment
[source,yaml]
----
techdocs:
  cache:
    ttl: 3600000

TIP: Optionally, enable also the Redis cache for unsupported plugins that have the feature. See their respective documentation.
