= Injecting custom files and environment variables into {backstage} containers

You must use the `spec.application` path to configure the injection of custom files and environment variables into your {backstage} Pod containers. This ensures necessary configurations, credentials, and dependencies (such as certificates) are available at runtime.

By default, resources inject into the **`backstage-backend`** container. You can also specify other targets, including a list of containers by name (such as `dynamic-plugin-install` or custom sidecars) or all containers in the {backstage} Pod.

.Procedure
To configure resource injection, use the following fields under `spec.application`:

* File injection (`spec.application.extraFiles`): To define external file resources to be mounted as volumes into the targeted containers, use the following fields:
** `configMaps`: Sources file volumes from Kubernetes ConfigMaps. 
** `secrets`: Sources file volumes from Kubernetes Secrets. 
** `pvcs`: Sources volume claims from Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

* Environment variable injection (`spec.application.extraEnvs`): To define the environment variables to be injected into the targeted containers, use the following fields:
** `configMaps`: Injects environment variables sourced from Kubernetes ConfigMaps. 
** `secrets`: Injects environment variables sourced from Kubernetes Secrets. 
** `envs`: Injects hardcoded environment variables defined directly in the manifest.
