= Enabling the {product} plugin assets cache

By default, {product} does not cache plugin assets.
You can use a Redis cache store to improve {product-short} performance and reliability.
Configured plugins in {product-short} receive dedicated cache connections, which are powered by the Keyv Redis client.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed {product}.
* You have an active Redis server.
For more information on setting up an external Redis server, see the link:https://www.redis.io/docs/latest/[`official Redis documentation`].

.Procedure
. Enable the {product-short} cache by defining Redis as the cache store type and entering your Redis server connection URL in your `{my-app-config-file}` file.

    connection: redis://user:pass@cache.example.com:6379

. Enable the cache for Techdocs by adding the `techdocs.cache.ttl` setting in your `{my-app-config-file}` file.
This setting specifies how long, in milliseconds, a statically built asset should stay in the cache.

TIP: Optionally, enable the cache for unsupported plugins that have the feature.
See their respective documentation.
