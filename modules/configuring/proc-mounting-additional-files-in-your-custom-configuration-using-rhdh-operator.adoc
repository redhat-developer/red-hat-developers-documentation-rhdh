[id="mounting-additional-files-in-your-custom-configuration-using-rhdh-operator"]
= Mounting additional files in your custom configuration using the {product} Operator

You can use the {product-short} Operator to mount extra files, such as a ConfigMap or Secret, to the container in a preferred location.

The `mountPath` field specifies the location where a ConfigMap or Secret is mounted. The behavior of the mount, whether it includes or excludes a `subPath`, depends on the specification of the `key` or `mountPath` fields.

* If `key` and `mountPath` are not specified: Each key or value is mounted as a `filename` or content with a `subPath`.
* If `key` is specified with or without `mountPath`: The specified key or value is mounted with a `subPath`.
* If only `mountPath` is specified: A directory containing all the keys or values is mounted without a `subPath`.

[NOTE]
====
* {ocp-short} does not automatically update a volume mounted with `subPath`. By default, the {product-very-short} Operator monitors these ConfigMaps or Secrets and refreshes the {product-very-short} Pod when changes occur.
* For security purposes, {product} does not give the Operator Service Account read access to Secrets. As a result, mounting files from Secrets without specifying both mountPath and key is not supported.
====


.Prerequisites
* You have developer permissions to access the {ocp-short} cluster containing your {product-short} instance using the {openshift-cli}.
* link:{installing-on-ocp-book-url}[Your {ocp-short} administrator has installed the {product} Operator in {ocp-short}].

.Procedure

. In {ocp-short}, create your ConfigMap or Secret with the following YAML codes:
+
.Minimal `{my-extra-file-configmap}` ConfigMap example
====
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {my-extra-file-configmap}
data:
  file11.txt: |
    My file11 content
  file 12.txt: |
    My file12 content

+
.Minimal {product} Secret example
====
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: `_<my_product_secrets>_`
StringData:
  secret11.txt: |
    secret-content

For more information, see xref:provisioning-your-custom-configuration[Provisioning and using your custom {product} configuration].

. Set the value of the `configMaps name` to the name of the ConfigMap or `secrets name` to the name of the Secret in your `{product-custom-resource-type}` CR. For example:
+
====
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
spec:
  application:
    extraFiles:
      mountPath: /my/path
      configMaps:
        - name: {my-extra-file-configmap}
          key: file12.txt
          mountPath: /my/my-rhdh-config-map/path
      secrets:
        - name: `_<my_product_secrets>_`
          key: secret11.txt
          mountPath: /my/my-rhdh-secret/path

----
====

[NOTE]
====
`_<my_product_secrets>_` is your preferred {product-short} secret name, where `_<my_product_secrets>_` specifies the identifier for your secret within {product-short}.
