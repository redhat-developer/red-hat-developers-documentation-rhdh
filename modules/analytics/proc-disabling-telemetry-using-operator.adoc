* You have installed {product} on {ocp-short} using the Operator.

.Procedure

. Perform one of the following steps:
+
* If you have created the `dynamic-plugins-rhdh` ConfigMap file and not configured the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin, add the plugin to the list of plugins and set its `plugins.disabled` parameter to `true`.
+
* If you have created the `dynamic-plugins-rhdh` ConfigMap file and configured the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin, search the plugin in the list of plugins and set its `plugins.disabled` parameter to `true`.
+
* If you have not created the ConfigMap file, create it with the following YAML code:
+
[source,yaml]
