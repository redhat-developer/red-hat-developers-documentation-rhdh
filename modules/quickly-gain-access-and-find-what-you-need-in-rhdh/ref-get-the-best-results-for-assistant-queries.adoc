= Get the best results for assistant queries

To receive accurate and helpful responses with {ls-short}, you must structure your queries effectively. Review the following best practices to improve the quality of the assistant's output:

* Be specific: Ask precise questions. For example, instead of "How do I use templates?", ask "How do I create a template that generates a React app?".
* Use natural language: Write in a conversational style. You do not need to use special keywords.
* Refine queries: Ask follow-up questions if the initial response is incomplete. The assistant maintains conversation context.
* Verify information: Review provided citations to validate important information.
* Provide feedback: Rate responses by clicking the *Thumbs up* or *Thumbs down* buttons.
