= Browse core resources using the left sidebar

Use the left navigation sidebar to browse available tools, catalogs, and documentation in {product-very-short}. The left sidebar organizes platform resources into sections, allowing you to locate specific services, APIs, and technical guides without switching contexts.
Standard navigation items include:

Home::
Returns you to your personalized dashboard, which includes "Welcome back" greetings, recent activity, and quickstart guides.

Catalog::
Opens the inventory of all software assets, allowing you to filter and browse components, services, and systems.

Docs::
Provides a centralized view of all technical documentation (TechDocs) available in your organization.

APIs::
Distinct from the Catalog, this section allows you to discover and test API definitions directly in the browser.

Administration::
(Restricted) Visible primarily to platform engineers for configuring users, permissions, and plugins.

As your organization enables more plugins, additional items (such as "Learning Paths" or specific tool integrations) might appear in this menu.
