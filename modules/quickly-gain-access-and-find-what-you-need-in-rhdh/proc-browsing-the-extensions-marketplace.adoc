= Identifying integrations in the {product-very-short} extensions marketplace

To enhance your development workflow with additional tools, browse the extensions marketplace in {product} ({product-very-short}). Identifying available plugins allows you to see which integrations are currently active or which supported tools your team can request to improve project visibility and automation.

.Procedure

. In the left navigation sidebar, click *Extensions*.
. Browse the marketplace to review the following categories:
* *Installed*: Review the integrations currently active in your instance, such as *Jira*, *ArgoCD*, or *GitHub*.
* *Available*: Examine additional integrations supported by the platform that are not yet enabled for your workspace.

[NOTE]
====
End users typically cannot install plugins. If you locate a plugin in the marketplace or the Backstage Plugin Directory that your team requires, contact your administrator to request its enablement.
