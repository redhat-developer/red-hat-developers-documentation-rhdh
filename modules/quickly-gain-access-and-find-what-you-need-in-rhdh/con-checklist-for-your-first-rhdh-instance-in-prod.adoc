= Checklist for your first {product-very-short} instance in production

As a developer accessing a production {product-very-short} instance for the first time, you need to verify your access, confirm your ownership of software components, and configure your personal workspace. This ensures you can immediately find your team's services and utilize self-service capabilities.

.1. Log in and verify your profile

Production environments often use different authentication providers (such as corporate SSO) than test environments. Your first step is to confirm you are logged in as the correct user and that the platform recognizes your identity.

Authenticate::
Access your organization's {product-very-short} URL and log in using your corporate credentials.

Check your Identity::
Click your avatar or name in the *Global Header* and select *Settings*. Verify that the User Entity matches your corporate identity.

Verify Ownership::
Navigate to *My Profile* from the user menu. Check the *Ownership* card to ensure it lists the components, APIs, and systems you or your team are responsible for. If this list is empty, you may need to register your ownership in the Software Catalog.

.2. Organize your workspace

{product-very-short} contains your organization's entire software ecosystem. To work efficiently, you should curate a list of resources you use daily.

Star your services::
Browse the Catalog, find the components you work on, and click the *Star icon* (⭐) to add them to your favorites.

Access Starred Items::
Verify that your starred components appear in the *Starred Items* list in the *Global Header* for quick access.

Pin the Sidebar::
If you navigate frequently between the Catalog, Templates, and Docs, go to *Settings* and toggle *Pin Sidebar* to keep the navigation menu visible.

.3. Explore production resources

Production instances often grant access to live infrastructure and specific documentation that may not be available in local or staging environments.

Review Production Documentation::
Use the *Docs* navigation item to check for "Runbooks" or "Production Deployment Guides" associated with your components.

Check Production APIs::
Navigate to the *APIs* page to verify that production API endpoints are discoverable and that their definitions (OpenAPI/Swagger) are up to date.

Test Self-Service Templates::
Click the *Create* (plus +) button in the *Global Header* to view available Software Templates. Ensure you have access to the "Golden Path" templates required for creating new production-ready services.

.Next steps

* *Start your day:* Navigate to the {product-very-short} *Home Page* to view your personalized dashboard, including "Your Items" and recently viewed resources.
* *Learn the interface:* Review the Navigation Guide to understand the Global Header and Sidebar tools.
* *Get AI assistance:* If enabled in production, open {ls-short} to ask questions about your new environment.
