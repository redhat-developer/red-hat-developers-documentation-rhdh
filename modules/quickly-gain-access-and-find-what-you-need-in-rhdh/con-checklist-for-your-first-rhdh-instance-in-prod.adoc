= Checklist for your first {product-very-short} instance in production

To establish a productive workflow in a production {product-very-short} instance as a developer, you must verify your access permissions, confirm ownership of software entities, and personalize your interface. With this process, you can locate team services and utilize self-service capabilities immediately.

.Log in and verify your profile

Because production environments often use different authentication providers (such as corporate SSO) than test environments, your first step is to confirm you are logged in as the correct user and that the platform recognizes your identity.

* *Authenticate*: Access your organization's {product-very-short} URL and xref:proc-logging-in-to-rhdh_{context}[log in using your corporate credentials].

* *Check your identity*: Click your avatar or name in the Global Header and select *Settings*. Verify that the *User Entity* matches your corporate identity.

* xref:proc-verifying-identity-and-ownership_{context}[*Verify Ownership*]: Navigate to *My Profile* from the user menu. Check the *Ownership* card to ensure it lists the components, APIs, and systems you or your team are responsible for. If this list is empty, you may need to register your ownership in the Software Catalog.

.Organize your workspace

To reduce navigation time across the software ecosystem, curate a list of high-priority resources.

* xref:proc-finding-components-in-rhdh_{context}[*Star your services*]: Locate your frequently used components in the *Catalog* and select the *Star* icon to add them to your favorites.
* *Access starred items*: Use the *Starred Items* menu in the Global Header to open your favorite resources quickly.
* *Pin the Sidebar*: If you switch frequently between tools, go to *Settings* and enable *Pin Sidebar* to keep the navigation menu permanently visible. See xref:proc-personalizing-navigation-experience_{context}[Personalizing the navigation experience in {product-very-short}].

.Explore production resources

Production instances provide access to live infrastructure data and technical guides required for operational tasks.

* xref:proc-techdocs-find-docs_{context}[*See production documentation*]: Use the *Docs* menu to find production-specific documentation, such as runbooks or deployment guides linked to your components.
* xref:proc-finding-api-definitions-in-rhdh_{context}[*Check production APIs*]: Navigate to the *APIs* page to confirm that production endpoint definitions are accurate and discoverable.
* *Test Self-Service templates*: Click *Create* (+) in the Global Header to examine available Software Templates. Confirm that you have access to the templates required to generate new production services.

.Next steps

* *Start your day:* Navigate to the {product-very-short} *Home Page* to view your personalized dashboard.
* *Learn the interface:* Review the Navigation Guide to understand the xref:ref-access-tools-and-search-using-global-header_{context}[Global Header] and xref:ref-browse-core-resources-using-the-left-sidebar_{context}[Sidebar tools].
* *Get AI assistance:* If enabled in production, open {ls-short} to ask questions about your new environment. For tips on querying, see xref:ref-get-the-best-results-for-assistant-queries_{context}[Get the best results for assistant queries].
