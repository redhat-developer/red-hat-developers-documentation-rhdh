= Optimize developer productivity with {product-very-short} core features

To streamline your software development lifecycle, use the integrated toolset within {product} ({product-very-short}). These core capabilities allow you to perform self-service tasks and discover organizational resources from a centralized interface.

.Developer workflow capabilities

By using the following features, you can reduce context switching and automate repetitive setup tasks:

Software Catalog::
Use this centralized inventory to manage software components, APIs, and systems. You can visualize ownership, track dependencies, and monitor the lifecycle status of assets across the organization.

Software Templates::
Automate the creation of new projects by using self-service templates. These templates bootstrap repositories, configure CI/CD pipelines, and apply organizational best practices to eliminate manual configuration.

TechDocs::
Access "docs-as-code" documentation that renders directly within the portal. This ensures that technical guides remain synchronized with the codebase and are easily discoverable alongside their corresponding services.

Plugins::
Extend the portal's functionality by connecting it to your existing toolchain. You can monitor *ArgoCD* deployments, view *Jira* tickets, or review *Quay* registry scans without navigating away from the portal interface.

Global Search::
Find specific components, documentation, or team members instantly by using a unified search engine that indexes the entire software ecosystem.
