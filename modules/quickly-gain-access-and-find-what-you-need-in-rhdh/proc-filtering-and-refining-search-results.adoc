. Click the *All results...* link at the bottom of the drop-down list.
. In the *Filters* panel, select options to refine the list:
** *Kind*: Select entity types such as *Component*, *API*, *Template*, or *Group*.
** *Type*: Select a subtype such as *service*, *library*, or *website*.
** *Lifecycle*: Filter by status, such as *production* or *experimental*.
. Review the filtered results, which display additional context such as descriptions and owners.
. Optional: Use the pagination controls to navigate through large sets of results.
