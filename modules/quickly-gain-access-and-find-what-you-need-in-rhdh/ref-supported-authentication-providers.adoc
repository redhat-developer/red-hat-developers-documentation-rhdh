Your organization configures specific authentication providers to manage secure access to {product-very-short}. Understanding which provider to use helps ensure you can access the tools and permissions relevant to your role.

Commonly supported authentication methods include:

Integration with corporate identity systems to allow you to use your standard company credentials.

Federated authentication::
Services such as *Keycloak* or *Ping Federate* that unify login across multiple applications.

OAuth providers::
Integration with platforms like GitHub to link your developer identity directly to the portal.

Guest access::
A restricted, read-only mode that allows users to explore the platform without full authentication. This is often used for demonstration or initial exploration purposes.
