= Setting up OpenShift Pipelines in the web console to view Software Supply Chain Security elements

Use the *Developer* or *Administrator* perspective to create or modify a pipeline and view key Software Supply Chain Security elements within a project.

Set up Openshift pipelines to view:

* **Project vulnerabilities**: Visual representation of identified vulnerabilities within a project.

* **Software Bill of Material (SBOM)**: Download or view detailed listing of software components.

Additionally, `PipelineRuns` that meet Tekton Chains requirement displays signed badge next to their names. This badge indicates that the PipelineRun artifacts are cryptographically signed and stored securely within an OCI registry.

The PipelineRun displays the signed badge next to its name only if you have configured Tekton Chains. For information on configuring Tekton Chains, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/1.13/secure/using-tekton-chains-for-openshift-pipelines-supply-chain-security.html[Using Tekton Chains for OpenShift Pipelines supply chain security].
