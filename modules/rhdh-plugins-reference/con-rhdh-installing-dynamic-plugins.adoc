= Installing dynamic plugins
The dynamic plugin support is based on the backend plugin manager package, which is a service that scans a configured root directory (dynamicPlugins.rootDirectory in the app config) for dynamic plugin packages, and loads them dynamically.

== Helm deployment
To deploy a {product} (RHDH) instance, you use a Helm Chart which is a flexible installation method.

You can sideload dynamic plugins into your {product-short} instance without having to recompile your code or rebuild the container.

To install dynamic plugins, you use the following `global.dynamic` parameters in your Helm Chart:  

* `plugins`: This field encompasses the list of dynamic plugins slated for installation. By default, it is an empty list. A package can be specified either as a local relative path (starting with ./) to the dynamic plugin's folder or as a package specification in an NPM repository.

* `includes`: This field contains a roster of YAML files utilizing the same syntax. The `plugins` list from these files will be incorporated, and potentially overridden, by the plugins list in the primary helm values. The default configuration includes the `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` file, which encompasses all the dynamic plugins included in {product-short}, whether enabled or disabled by default.

== Installing a dynamic plugin using the Helm Chart

You can include a dynamic plugin in RHDH by appending an entry to the `global.dynamic.plugins` list in your Helm Chart.

Each entry must contain the following fields:

* `package`: a package specification of the dynamic plugin package to be installed (can be from a local path or an NPM repository)

* `integrity`: (optional for local packages) An integrity checksum in the form of <alg>-<digest> for the specific package. Supported algorithms include `sha256`, `sha384` and `sha512`.

* `pluginConfig`: an optional plugin-specific app-config yaml fragment. See plugin configuration for more details.

* `disabled`: disables the dynamic plugin if set to `true`. Default: `false`.

== Examples

.Example 1: Enabling two plugins from a local and remote source, one requiring a specific app-config
[source,java]
----
global:
  dynamic:
    plugins:
      - package: <a local package-spec used by npm pack>
      - package: <a remote package-spec used by npm pack>
        integrity: sha512-<some hash>
        pluginConfig: ...
----

.Example 2: Disabling a plugin from an included file
[source,java]
----
global:
  dynamic:
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: <some imported plugins listed in dynamic-plugins.default.yaml>
        disabled: true
----

.Example 3: Enabling a plugin from an included file
[source,java]
----
global:
  dynamic:
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: <some imported plugins listed in dynamic-plugins.custom.yaml>
        disabled: false
----

== Dynamic plugins included in {product}

{product} ({product-short}) is pre-loaded with a selection of dynamic plugins. Most of these dynamic plugins are disabled by default due to the need for mandatory configuration. 
 
For a complete list of dynamic plugins that are included in this release of RHDH, see the xref:rhdh-supported-plugins[Dynamic Plugins Matrix] 

Upon application startup, for each plugin that is disabled by default, the `install-dynamic-plugins init container` within the {product-short} pod's log displays a line similar to the following:

[source,yaml]
----
======= Skipping disabled dynamic plugin ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-dynamic
----

To activate this plugin, simply add a package with the same name and adjust the disabled field in the Helm Chart values as shown below:

[source,java]
----
global:
  dynamic:
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-dynamic
        disabled: false
----
[NOTE]
The default configuration for a plugin is extracted from the `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` file, however, you can use a `pluginConfig` entry to override this default configuration.

== Basic configuration of dynamic plugins
Some dynamic plugins require environment variables to be set. If a mandatory environment variable is not set, and the plugin is enabled, then the application might fail at startup.

The mandatory environment variables for each plugin are listed in the Dynamic Plugins Support Matrix table. 

[NOTE]
====
Zib-bomb detection 
When installing some dynamic plugin containing large files, if the installation script considers the package archive to be a Zib-Bomb, the installation will fail.

To increase the maximum permitted size of a file inside a package archive, you can increase the  `MAX_ENTRY_SIZE` environment value of the deployment `install-dynamic-plugins initContainer` from the default size of `20000000` bytes.
