= Installing dynamic plugins
The dynamic plugin support is based on the backend plugin manager package, which is a service that scans a configured root directory (dynamicPlugins.rootDirectory in the app config) for dynamic plugin packages, and loads them dynamically.

== Helm deployment
To deploy a {product} (RHDH) instance, you use a Helm Chart which is a flexible installation method.

You can sideload dynamic plugins into your {product-short} instance without having to recompile your code or rebuild the container.

To install dynamic plugins, you use the following `global.dynamic` parameters in your Helm Chart:  

* `plugins`: This field encompasses the list of dynamic plugins slated for installation. By default, it is an empty list. A package can be specified either as a local relative path (starting with ./) to the dynamic plugin's folder or as a package specification in an NPM repository.

* `includes`: This field contains a roster of YAML files utilizing the same syntax. The `plugins` list from these files will be incorporated, and potentially overridden, by the plugins list in the primary helm values. The default configuration includes the `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` file, which encompasses all the dynamic plugins included in {product-short}, whether enabled or disabled by default.

== Dynamic plugin installation using the Helm Chart

You can include a dynamic plugin in RHDH by appending an entry to the `global.dynamic.plugins` list in your Helm Chart.

Each entry must contain the following fields:

* `package`: a package specification of the dynamic plugin package to be installed (can be from a local path or an NPM repository)

* `integrity`: (optional for local packages) An integrity checksum in the form of <alg>-<digest> for the specific package. Supported algorithms include `sha256`, `sha384` and `sha512`.

* `pluginConfig`: an optional plugin-specific app-config yaml fragment. See plugin configuration for more details.

* `disabled`: disables the dynamic plugin if set to `true`. Default: `false`.

=== Examples

.Example 1: Enabling two plugins from a local and remote source, one requiring a specific app-config
[source,java]
----
global:
  dynamic:
    plugins:
      - package: <a local package-spec used by npm pack>
      - package: <a remote package-spec used by npm pack>
        integrity: sha512-<some hash>
        pluginConfig: ...
----

.Example 2: Disabling a plugin from an included file
[source,java]
----
global:
  dynamic:
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: <some imported plugins listed in dynamic-plugins.default.yaml>
        disabled: true
----

.Example 3: Enabling a plugin from an included file
[source,java]
----
global:
  dynamic:
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: <some imported plugins listed in dynamic-plugins.custom.yaml>
        disabled: false
----

== Dynamic plugins pre-loaded in {product}

{product} ({product-short}) is pre-loaded with a selection of dynamic plugins. Most of these dynamic plugins are disabled by default due to the need for mandatory configuration. 
 
For a complete list of dynamic plugins that are included in this release of RHDH, see the xref:rhdh-supported-plugins[dynamic plugins matrix] table.

Upon application startup, for each plugin that is disabled by default, the `install-dynamic-plugins init container` within the {product-short} pod's log displays a line similar to the following:

[source,yaml]
----
======= Skipping disabled dynamic plugin ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-dynamic
----

To activate this plugin, simply add a package with the same name and adjust the disabled field in the Helm Chart values as shown below:

[source,java]
----
global:
  dynamic:
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-dynamic
        disabled: false
----
[NOTE]
The default configuration for a plugin is extracted from the `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` file, however, you can use a `pluginConfig` entry to override this default configuration.

== Basic configuration of dynamic plugins
Some dynamic plugins require environment variables to be set. If a mandatory environment variable is not set, and the plugin is enabled, then the application might fail at startup.

The mandatory environment variables for each plugin are listed in the xref:rhdh-supported-plugins[dynamic plugins matrix] table. 

[NOTE]
====
Zib-bomb detection 
When installing some dynamic plugin containing large files, if the installation script considers the package archive to be a Zib-Bomb, the installation fails.

To increase the maximum permitted size of a file inside a package archive, you can increase the  `MAX_ENTRY_SIZE` environment value of the deployment `install-dynamic-plugins initContainer` from the default size of `20000000` bytes.
