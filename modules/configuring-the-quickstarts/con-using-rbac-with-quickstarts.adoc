= About access to Quickstarts with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
You can control user access to Quickstarts by using RBAC to define user roles.

== Overview of user roles
You can define user roles to control access to your Quickstarts by using the following logic in your RBAC configuration:

* If RBAC is disabled (`permission.enabled: false`) or not configured, users are assumed to be platform engineers setting up {product} ({product-very-short}) and are assigned the admin role.
* If RBAC is enabled (`permission.enabled: true`), the system determines user roles based on permissions:
** Users with `policy.entity.create` permission are assigned the admin role.
** Users without this permission are assigned the developer role.

== Supported roles
admin:: Platform engineers, administrators, and users with elevated permissions
developer:: Regular developers and users with standard permissions

== RBAC configuration for a Quickstart

The following behavior applies when you use RBAC to assign roles for your Quickstarts:

* Quickstart items without a `roles` property default to `['admin']`.
* Items can specify multiple roles, for example, `roles: ['admin', 'developer']`.
* Users see Quickstart items that match their assigned role.
