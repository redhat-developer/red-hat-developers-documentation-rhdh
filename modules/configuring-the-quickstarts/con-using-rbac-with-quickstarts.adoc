= About access to Quickstarts with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
You can control user access to Quickstarts by using RBAC to define user roles that use the following logic in your RBAC configuration:

* If RBAC is enabled (`permission.enabled: true`), the system determines user roles based on permissions, as follows:
** Users with `policy.entity.create` permission are assigned the admin role.
** Users without this permission are assigned the developer role.

[NOTE]
====
If RBAC is disabled (`permission.enabled: false`) or not configured, users are assumed to be platform engineers setting up {product} ({product-very-short}) and are assigned the admin role.
====

The following two roles are supported for defining access to Quickstarts:

admin:: Platform engineers, administrators, and users with elevated permissions
developer:: Regular developers and users with standard permissions

The following behavior applies when you use RBAC to assign roles for your Quickstarts:

* Quickstart items without a `roles` property default to the admin role.
* Items can specify multiple roles, for example, admin and developer.
* Users see Quickstart items that match their assigned role.

.Example configuring RBAC for a Quickstart in your {my-app-config-file} file
