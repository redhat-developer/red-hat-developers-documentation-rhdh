= Configuring access to Quickstarts with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
You can control user access to Quickstarts by using RBAC to define roles.

== User roles
You can define user roles using the following logic in your RBAC configuration.

When RBAC is disabled (`permission.enabled: false` or not configured):: Users are assumed to be platform engineers setting up RHDH and are assigned the admin role.
When RBAC is enabled (permission.enabled: true):: User roles are determined based on permissions:
* Users with `policy.entity.create` permission are assigned the admin role.
* Users without this permission are assigned the developer role.

== Supported Roles
admin:: Platform engineers, administrators, and users with elevated permissions
developer:: Regular developers and users with standard permissions

== Role Assignment Behavior
* Quickstart items without a `roles` property default to ['admin']
* Items can specify multiple `roles`: roles: ['admin', 'developer']
* Users only see quickstart items that match their assigned role

== Configuring RBAC for a quickstart.
