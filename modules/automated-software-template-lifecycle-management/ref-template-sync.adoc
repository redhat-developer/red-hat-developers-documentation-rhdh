= Template sync considerations and limitations

Review the following details to troubleshoot or refine the synchronization process.

.Reviewer assignment
The plugin automatically assigns a reviewer if the entity owner is a *User* entity with a defined VCS login.

* *GitHub*: Requires the `github.com/user-login` annotation.
* *GitLab*: Requires the `gitlab.com/user-login` annotation.
If the owner is a *Group*, the plugin creates the PR without an assigned reviewer.

.Variable resolution limitations
The synchronization engine uses regex matching to resolve template variables like `${{ values.name }}`. You must manually review PRs because:

* Variables that do not match keys in the scaffolded repository remain in raw template syntax.
* Conditional Jinja2 blocks (`{% if %}`) are stripped, which might cause unexpected formatting.
* Complex nested structures might not resolve correctly.

.Error handling
If a PR fails to create due to credential issues or network errors, the plugin:

* Logs the error in the backend.
* Sends a failure notification to the entity owner (if notifications are enabled).
* Skips the sync if no file differences are detected between the template and the repository.
