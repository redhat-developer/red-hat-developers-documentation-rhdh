= {product-short} catalog database changes

In {product} {ocp-version-min} and later, changes to the catalog database are forwarded to a central log management system, such as ElasticSearch or Splunk by default. Administrators can view changes that add, remove, or update data in the catalog database to help ensure accountability and transparency of user actions.
