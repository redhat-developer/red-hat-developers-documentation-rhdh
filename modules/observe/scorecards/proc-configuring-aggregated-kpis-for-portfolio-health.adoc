= Configuring aggregated KPIs for portfolio health

To monitor the health of software portfolios, you must configure the aggregation settings and refresh schedule in the {product-short-name} configuration.

.Procedure

. Open your {product-very-short} `{my-app-config-file}` file and navigate to the `scorecard` configuration block.
. Add the `aggregation` key to define how component metrics are calculated. Supported functions include:
* `avg`: Calculates the average score across all components in the portfolio.
* `sum`: Totals the scores of all components.
* `min`: Displays the lowest score within the portfolio.
* `max`: Displays the highest score within the portfolio.
. Configure the `refreshSchedule` to determine how often the system recalculates these values. Use a duration format, such as `12h` or `24h`.
. Save the changes and restart your {product-short-name} instance to apply the configuration.
