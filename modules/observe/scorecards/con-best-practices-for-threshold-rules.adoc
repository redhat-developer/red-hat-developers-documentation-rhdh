= Best practices for threshold rules

Threshold rule evaluation is order-dependent. You must follow logical ordering to avoid unintended category assignments, as the system stops evaluation once a value matches the first rule.

== Follow logical ordering

Rules must be sequenced logically. Order rules from the most strict (smallest range) to the least strict (largest range) or ensure all ranges are mutually exclusive.

=== Problematic Rule Order Example

If rules are ordered incorrectly, a less restrictive rule can prevent stricter rules from being evaluated:

. `warning: <50`: Any value less than 50 triggers the warning rule and stops evaluation.
. `success: <10`: This rule is not evaluated because all values less than 10 already matched the preceding warning rule.

=== Correct Ordering Example

Order the rules from the most restrictive value range to the least restrictive to ensure logical flow.

# Correct Example: Order from most restrictive (Error) to least restrictive (Success)
rules:
  - key: success
    expression: '>50'     # All remaining values above 50
  - key: warning
    expression: '10-50'   # Only values between 10 and 50
  - key: error
    expression: '<10'     # Only values below 10
