= Verify logical flow in Scorecard threshold rules

Since Scorecard evaluates rules in order and stops at the first match, proper sequencing is essential for accurate health classification.

== Evaluation order for rules

To ensure the system evaluates all values correctly, sequence rules from the most strict (smallest range) value to the least strict (largest range). If rules are ordered incorrectly, a broad rule can prevent the system from reaching stricter rules.

=== Problematic rule order example

If rules are ordered incorrectly, a less restrictive rule can prevent stricter rules from being evaluated:

. `warning: <50`: Any value less than 50 triggers the warning rule and stops evaluation.
. `success: <10`: This rule is not evaluated because all values less than 10 have already matched the preceding warning rule.

=== Correct ordering example

The following example demonstrates the correct sequence for successes, warnings, and errors:

[source,yaml]
----
rules:
  - key: success
    expression: '<10'     # Most restrictive: Only values below 10
  - key: warning
    expression: '10-50'   # Values between 10 and 50
  - key: error
    expression: '>50'     # Least restrictive: All values above 50
