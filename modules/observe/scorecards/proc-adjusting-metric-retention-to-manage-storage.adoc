= Adjust metric retention to manage storage

To manage storage capacity and comply with data retention policies, adjust the number of days the Scorecard plugin retains metric data to align with your organization's policies. By default, the system retains metrics for 365 days.

.Procedure

. Open your {product-very-short} `{my-app-config-file}` file.
. In the `scorecard` section, add or update the `dataRetentionDays` parameter with the desired number of days:
+
[source,yaml]
----
scorecard:
  dataRetentionDays: 12
----
. Save the file.
. Restart the {product-very-short} backend to apply the changes.

.Verification

. Review the backend logs during the next scheduled cleanup cycle to make sure the job runs without errors.
. Query the database to confirm that records older than your specified limit are removed.
