= Set global standards for metric thresholds

To override the default thresholds set by a metric provider, you must update your `{product-very-short} app-config.yaml` file under the configuration path of the specific metric.

The custom configuration completely replaces the provider's defaults. If you omit a threshold category (such as `success`), that category is not assigned unless it is explicitly overridden later by an entity annotation in the `catalog-info.yaml` file.

The following configuration defines a `success` threshold as 10 or fewer issues, which applies to all components using the `jira.open_issues` metric unless explicitly overridden by an entity annotation.
