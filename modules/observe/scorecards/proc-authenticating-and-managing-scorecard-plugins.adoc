= Installing and configuring Scorecard to view metrics

As an administrator, you must grant users read access to Scorecard metrics by using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You can configure these permissions in the RBAC CSV file or the RBAC UI.

.Prerequisite
 * You have {authorization-book-link}#enabling-and-giving-access-to-rbac[enabled RBAC, have a policy administrator role in {product-very-short}, and have added `scorecard` to plugins with permission].

.Procedure
Grant the required permissions by using one of the following methods:

* To use the RBAC CSV file, add the following policy to your CSV file to allow users to view metrics:
+
[source,yaml]
----
g, user:default/<YOUR_USERNAME>, role:default/scorecard-viewer
p, role:default/scorecard-viewer, scorecard.metric.read, read, allow
p, role:default/scorecard-viewer, catalog.entity.read, read, allow
----
+
See {authorization-book-link}#ref-rbac-permission-policies_title-authorization[Permission policies reference].

* To use the RBAC Web UI, complete the following steps:
.. In the {product} menu, navigate to *Administration > RBAC*.
.. Select or create the *Role* that requires Scorecard access.
.. In the *Add permission policies* section, select *Scorecard* from the plugins dropdown.
.. Expand the *Scorecard* entry, select *policy* with the following details, and click *Next*:
*** *Name*: `scorecard.metric.read`
*** *Permission*: `read`
