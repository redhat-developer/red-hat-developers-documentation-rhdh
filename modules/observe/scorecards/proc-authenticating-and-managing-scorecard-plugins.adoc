= Authenticating and managing Scorecard plugins to control who sees the metrics

As an administrator, you can secure the connection to your metric providers by managing user access to the Scorecards using the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions. For users to view the Scorecard metrics, you must grant users with read access to the Scorecard metrics. You can configure these permissions either by modifying your RBAC CSV file directly or by using the RBAC Web UI.

.Prerequisite
 * You have {authorization-book-link}#enabling-and-giving-access-to-rbac[enabled RBAC, have a policy administrator role in {product-very-short}, and have added `scorecard` to plugins with permission].

.Procedure
Use any of the following methods to set the required RBAC permissions:

* To use the CSV file, in your CSV file, you can directly add the following code:
+
[source,yaml]
----
g, user:default/<YOUR_USERNAME>, role:default/scorecard-viewer
p, role:default/scorecard-viewer, scorecard.metric.read, read, allow
p, role:default/scorecard-viewer, catalog.entity.read, read, allow
----
+
See {authorization-book-link}#ref-rbac-permission-policies_title-authorization[Permission policies reference].

* To use the RBAC Web UI, complete the following steps:
.. In your {product} menu, go to *Administration > RBAC*.
.. Select or create the *Role* to which you want to grant access to the Scorecards.
.. To enable read access for the Scorecard plugin, in *Add permission policies*, select *Scorecard* from the plugins dropdown.
.. Expand *Scorecard*, select *policy* with the following details, and click *Next*:
*** *Name*: `scorecard.metric.read`
*** *Permission*: `read`
