= Component health and compliance monitoring using Scorecards

include::{docdir}/artifacts/snip-developer-preview-scorecard.adoc[]

The Scorecard plugin centralizes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in {product} {product-very-short} so you can monitor the health, security, and compliance of your services. By aggregating data in one interface, you can evaluate component quality without switching between external systems.

Use the Scorecard plugin to achieve the following goals:

* Identify and prioritize risks: Use unified health data to make faster remediation decisions.
* Maintain security standards: Automatically surface compliance gaps to enforce best practices.
* Streamline workflows: Access all metrics in {product-very-short} to reduce development overhead.
* Standardize service quality: Define and measure consistent health criteria across the organization.
