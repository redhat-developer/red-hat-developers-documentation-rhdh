The Scorecard plugin offers comprehensive, customizable insights into the health, security posture, and compliance of your components, services, and APIs. It centralizes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) within {product} ({product-very-short}), so you do not have to consult multiple external systems.

The Scorecard plugin offers the following benefits:

* Accelerated decision-making: Scorecards provide an at-a-glance view of component readiness. Engineering and platform teams can use this data to quickly identify risks and prioritize remediation efforts, enabling faster, more effective decisions.

* Improved security and compliance: The plugin automatically surfaces compliance gaps against predefined standards (such as required security checks). This capability enforces best practices and helps maintain a stronger overall security posture.

* Reduced context switching: Centralizing all KPIs in {product-very-short} reduces the time developers spend hunting for data across different tools. Developers can then focus more on building and shipping features.

* Standardization and consistency: Scorecards help drive organizational consistency by clearly defining and measuring what "good" looks like for every service. This process fosters a more uniform and reliable ecosystem.
