= Standardize Scorecard metric thresholds across components

You can define global thresholds in your `{product-very-short} {my-app-config-file}` file to standardize health indicators across all components. Global configurations replace the default thresholds provided by a metric source.

If you omit a threshold category, such as `success`, the Scorecard plugin does not assign that category to the metric.

The following example defines thresholds for the `jira.open_issues` metric. These settings apply to all components using this metric unless an entity annotation overrides them.
