= View aggregated metrics for owned entities

To monitor the collective health of your software portfolio, you can view aggregated metrics for your owned entities in {product-very-short}. The Scorecard plugin automatically consolidates these metrics based on your ownership definitions in the Software Catalog, which eliminates the need for manual group selection.

.Prerequisites

* (To view aggregated KPIs) You have established owner group relationships in the Software Catalog.
* You have administrative access to the {product-very-short} configuration.
* You have the `catalog.entity.read` permission for the entities included in the aggregation.
* You have the `scorecard.metric.read` permission to view aggregated metrics on the home page.

.Procedure

. Navigate to your {product-very-short} home page.
. Locate the *Scorecard* dashboard to view the aggregated metrics for your owned entities.
. Optional: To include entities from a nested group hierarchy in the aggregation, you must {authentication-book-link}#enabling-transitive-parent-groups[enable transitive parent group ownership].

.Verification

* Confirm that the displayed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) reflect the status of all components, systems, and resources defined under your ownership in the Software Catalog.
