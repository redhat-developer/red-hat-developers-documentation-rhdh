= Schedule metrics to avoid API limits

To balance data freshness with system performance and API rate limits, you can customize the collection frequency for Scorecard metrics. Scorecard uses the {backstage} built-in scheduler service. The default refresh frequency is hourly, but you can adjust it for each metric.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrative access to the {product-very-short} configuration.
* You have identified the `datasourceId` and `metricName` for the provider you want to configure.

.Procedure

. Open your {product-very-short} `{my-app-config-file}` file.
. Navigate to the `scorecard.plugins` section.
. Add a schedule configuration for your specific data source and metric using the following structure:
+
[source,yaml]
----
scorecard:
  plugins:
    my_datasource:
      example_metric:
        schedule:
          frequency:
            cron: '0 6 * * *'
          timeout:
            minutes: 5
          initialDelay:
            minutes: 1
----
. Define the schedule parameters based on the `Backstage SchedulerServiceTaskScheduleDefinitionConfig` schema.
. Save the file.
. Restart the {product-very-short} backend to apply the changes.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
**Constraints:** You must make sure the configured frequency does not exceed the API rate limits of your metric provider.
====

.Verification

* Review the backend logs to make sure the task is scheduled without errors.
* Verify that new metric data appears in the database according to the defined interval.
