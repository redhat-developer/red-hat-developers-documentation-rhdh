= Scheduling metrics to avoid API limits

You can customize the frequency at which the Scorecard plugin collects data from registered providers. Scorecard uses the {backstage} built-in scheduler service. The default refresh frequency is hourly, but you can adjust it for each metric. Customizing this schedule helps you balance data freshness with system performance and API rate limits. 

.Prerequisites

* You have administrative access to the {product-very-short} configuration.
* You have identified the `datasourceId` and `metricName` for the provider you want to configure.

.Procedure

. Open your {product-very-short} `{my-app-config-file}` file.
. Navigate to the `scorecard.plugins` section.
. Add a schedule configuration for your specific data source and metric using the following structure:
+
[source,yaml]
----
scorecard:
  plugins:
    my_datasource:
      example_metric:
        schedule:
          frequency:
            cron: '0 6 * * *'
          timeout:
            minutes: 5
          initialDelay:
            minutes: 1
----
. Define the schedule parameters based on the `Backstage SchedulerServiceTaskScheduleDefinitionConfig` schema.
. Save the file.
. Restart the {product-very-short} backend to apply the changes.

.Verification

* Review the backend logs to make sure the task is scheduled without errors.
* Verify that new metric data appears in the database according to the defined interval.

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Constraints:** You must make sure the configured frequency does not exceed the API rate limits of your metric provider.
