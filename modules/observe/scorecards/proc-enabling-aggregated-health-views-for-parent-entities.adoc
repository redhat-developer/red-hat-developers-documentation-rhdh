= Enabling aggregated health views for parent entities

You can configure the Scorecard plugin to aggregate results for parent entities by updating your {product-very-short} configuration.

.Prerequisites

* The Scorecard plugin is installed and configured.
* You have administrative access to your {product-very-short} `{my-app-config-file}` file.

.Procedure

. Open your {product-very-short} `{my-app-config-file}` file.
. Navigate to the `scorecard` section under `catalog`.
. Add the `aggregation` configuration to enable the feature for specific entity kinds:
+
[source,yaml]
----
catalog:
  providers:
    scorecard:
      aggregation:
        enabled: true
        kinds:
          - System
          - Domain
----
. Save the changes to your {product-very-short} `{my-app-config-file}` file.
. Restart your {product-very-short} instance to apply the configuration.
. To enable aggregation for a specific entity, you must update the `catalog-info.yaml` of the entity to include the `scorecard.redhat.com/aggregation` annotation:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: System
metadata:
  name: my-system
  annotations:
    scorecard.redhat.com/aggregation: 'enabled'
spec:
  owner: guest
----

.Verification

. In the {product-very-short} catalog, select a parent entity that you configured.
. Confirm that the *Scorecard* tab displays aggregated results from all child components.
