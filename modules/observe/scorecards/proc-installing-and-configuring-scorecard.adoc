= Installing and configuring Scorecard to view metrics

To view Scorecard metrics in {product-very-short}, you need to grant read access using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Configure these permissions using the RBAC CSV file or the RBAC UI, depending on how you manage access in your environment.

.Prerequisite
 * You have {authorization-book-link}#enabling-and-giving-access-to-rbac[enabled RBAC and assigned a policy administrator role].
 * You have added `scorecard` to the list of plugins with permissions.

.Procedure

. Grant the required permissions by using one of the following methods:

* To use the RBAC CSV file, add the following policy to your CSV file to allow users to view metrics:
+
[source,yaml]
----
g, user:default/<YOUR_USERNAME>, role:default/scorecard-viewer
p, role:default/scorecard-viewer, scorecard.metric.read, read, allow
p, role:default/scorecard-viewer, catalog.entity.read, read, allow
----
+
See {authorization-book-link}#ref-rbac-permission-policies_title-authorization[Permission policies reference].

* To use the RBAC Web UI, complete the following steps:
.. In the {product} menu, navigate to *Administration > RBAC*.
.. Select or create the *Role* for Scorecard access.
.. In the *Add permission policies* section, select *Scorecard* from the plugins list.
.. Expand the *Scorecard* entry, select *policy* with the following details, and click *Next*:
*** *Name*: `scorecard.metric.read`
*** *Permission*: `read`

. Optional: Restrict access to specific metrics using a conditional policy:

** {audit-log-book-link}#managing-authorizations-by-using-the-web-ui[Using the Web UI]. 
** Define conditional policies in an `rbac-conditional-policies.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
result: CONDITIONAL
roleEntityRef: "role:default/scorecard-viewer"
pluginId: scorecard
resourceType: scorecard-metric
permissionMapping:
  - read
conditions:
  rule: HAS_METRIC_ID
  resourceType: scorecard-metric
  params:
    metricIds: [_<your_metric_id>_]
----
+
where:
`metricIds`:: Enter the metric ID for user access, such as `github.open_prs`.

This policy allows users to read only the specific metrics while restricting access to other available metrics.
