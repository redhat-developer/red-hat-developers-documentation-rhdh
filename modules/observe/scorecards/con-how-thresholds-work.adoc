= How Thresholds work

A threshold defines a condition or an expression that determines which visual category a metric value belongs to.

* Evaluation Order: Threshold rules are evaluated in the order they are defined. The first matching rule is applied to the metric value.
* Allowed Categories: Only three keys are supported: `success`, `warning`, and `error`.
* Best Practice: Always order rules from the most restrictive to the least restrictive to ensure logical assignment.
