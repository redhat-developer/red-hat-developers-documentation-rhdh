= Scorecard metric threshold categorization rules

A threshold defines conditions or expressions to assign metric values to specific visual categories.

To categorize metric values accurately, you must follow the following evaluation rules:

* Sequential evaluation: The system processes threshold rules in the order you define them and applies only the first matching rule.
* Restrictive ordering: You must sequence rules from the most restrictive range to the least restrictive range to verify that the system assigns categories correctly.
* Supported categories: Use only the `success`, `warning`, and `error` keys to define thresholds.
