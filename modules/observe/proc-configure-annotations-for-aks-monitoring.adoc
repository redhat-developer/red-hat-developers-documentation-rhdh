= Configuring annotations for monitoring

You can configure the annotations for monitoring {product} specific metrics in both Helm deployment and Operator-backed deployment.

Helm deployment::
+
--
To annotate the backstage pod for monitoring, update your `values.yaml` file as follows:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
upstream:
  backstage:
    # --- TRUNCATED ---
    podAnnotations:
      prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'
      prometheus.io/path: '/metrics'
      prometheus.io/port: '9464'
      prometheus.io/scheme: 'http'
----
--

Operator-backed deployment::
+
--
.Procedure

. As an administrator of the operator, edit the default configuration to add Prometheus annotations as follows:
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
# Update OPERATOR_NS accordingly
OPERATOR_NS=rhdh-operator
kubectl edit configmap backstage-default-config -n "${OPERATOR_NS}"
----

. Find the `deployment.yaml` key in the ConfigMap and add the annotations to the `spec.template.metadata.annotations` field as follows:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
deployment.yaml: |-
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  # --- truncated ---
  spec:
    template:
      # --- truncated ---
      metadata:
        labels:
         rhdh.redhat.com/app:  # placeholder for 'backstage-<cr-name>'
        # --- truncated ---
        annotations:
          prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'
          prometheus.io/path: '/metrics'
          prometheus.io/port: '9464'
          prometheus.io/scheme: 'http'
  # --- truncated ---
