= Enabling Azure Monitor metrics

To enable managed Prometheus monitoring, use the `-enable-azure-monitor-metrics` option within either the `az aks create` or `az aks update` command, depending on whether you're creating a new cluster or updating an existing one, such as:

[source,bash]
----
az aks create/update --resource-group <your-ResourceGroup> --name <your-Cluster> --enable-azure-monitor-metrics
----

The previous command installs the metrics add-on, which gathers https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview[Prometheus metrics]. Using the previous command, you can enable monitoring of Azure resources through both native Azure Monitor metrics. You can also view the results in the portal under *Monitoring -> Insights*. For more information, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource[Monitor Azure resources with Azure Monitor].

Furthermore, metrics from both the Managed Prometheus service and Azure Monitor can be accessed through Azure Managed Grafana service. For more information, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage?tabs=azure-portal#link-a-grafana-workspace[Link a Grafana workspace] section.

By default, Prometheus uses the minimum ingesting profile, which optimizes ingestion volume and sets default configurations for scrape frequency, targets, and metrics collected. The default settings can be customized through custom configuration. Azure offers various methods, including using different ConfigMaps, to provide scrape configuration and other metric add-on settings. For more information about default configuration, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default[Default Prometheus metrics configuration in Azure Monitor] and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration?tabs=CRDConfig%2CCRDScrapeConfig[Customize scraping of Prometheus metrics in Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus] documentation.
