= Audit log file rotation in {product}

Logging to a rotating file in {product} is helpful for persistent storage of audit logs.

Persistent storage ensures that the file remains intact even after a pod is restarted. Audit log file rotation creates a new file at regular intervals, with only new data being written to the latest file.

Default settings::

Audit logging to a rotating file is disabled by default. When it is enabled, the default behavior changes to:

* Rotate logs at midnight (local system timezone).
* Log file format: `redhat-developer-hub-audit-%DATE%.log`.
* Log files are stored in `/var/log/redhat-developer-hub/audit`.
* No automatic log file deletion.
* No gzip compression of archived logs.
* No file size limit.

Audit logs are written in the `/var/log/redhat-developer-hub/audit` directory.

Log file names::

Audit log file names are in the following format:

`redhat-developer-hub-audit-%DATE%.log`

where `%DATE%` is the format specified in `auditLog.rotateFile.dateFormat`. You can customize file names when you configure file rotation.

File rotation date and frequency::

Supported `auditLog.rotateFile.frequency` options include:

* `daily`: Rotate daily at 00:00 local time
* `Xm`: Rotate every `X` minutes (where X is a number between 0 and 59)
* `Xh`: Rotate every `X` hours (where X is a number between 0 and 23)
* `test`: Rotate every 1 minute
* `custom`: Use `dateFormat` to set the rotation frequency (default if frequency is not specified)

If `frequency` is set to `Xh`, `Xm` or `test`, the `dateFormat` setting must be configured in a format that includes the specified time component. Otherwise, the rotation might not work as expected.

For example, use `dateFormat: 'YYYY-MM-DD-HH` for hourly rotation, and `dateFormat: 'YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm` for minute rotation.

.Example minute rotation:
[source,yaml]
----
auditLog:
  rotateFile:
    # If you want to rotate the file every 17 minutes
    dateFormat: 'YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm'
    frequency: '17m'
----

The `dateFormat` setting configures both the `%DATE%` in `logFileName` and the file rotation frequency if `frequency` is set to `custom`. The default format is `YYYY-MM-DD`, meaning daily rotation. Supported values are based on link:https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/[Moment.js formats].

If the `frequency` is set to `custom`, then rotations take place when the date string, which is represented in the specified `dateFormat`, changes.

Archive and delete::

By default, log files are not archived or deleted.

Enable and configure audit file rotation::

If you are an administrator of {product-short}, you can enable file rotation for audit logs, and configure the file log location, name format, frequency,  log file size, retention policy, and archiving.

.Example audit log file rotation configuration
[source,yaml]
----
auditLog:
  rotateFile:
    enabled: true <1>
    logFileDirPath: /custom-path <2>
    logFileName: custom-audit-log-%DATE%.log <3>
    frequency: '12h' <4>
    dateFormat: 'YYYY-MM-DD' <5>
    utc: false <6>
    maxSize: 100m <7>
    maxFilesOrDays: 14 <8>
    zippedArchive: true <9>
----
<1> Set `enabled` to `true` to use audit log file rotation. By default, it is set to `false`.
<2> Absolute path to the log file. The specified directory is created automatically if it does not exist.
<3> Default log file name format.
<4> If no frequency is specified, then the default file rotation occurs daily at 00:00 local time.
<5> Default date format.
<6> Set `utc` to `true` to use UTC time for `dateFormat` instead of local time.
<7> Sets a maximum file size limit for the audit log. In this example, the maximum size is 100m.
<8> If set to number of files, for example `14`, then it deletes the oldest log when there are more than 14 log files. If set to number of days, for example `5d`, then it deletes logs older than 5 days.
<9> Archive and compress rotated logs using `gzip`. The default value is `false`.

[NOTE]
====
* By default, log files are not archived or deleted. If log deletion is enabled, then a `.<sha256 hash>-audit.json` is generated in the directory where the logs are to track generated logs. Any log file not contained in the directory is not subject to automatic deletion.
* A new `.<sha256 hash>-audit.json` file is generated each time the backend starts, which causes previous audit logs to stop being tracked or deleted, except for those still in use by the current backend.
