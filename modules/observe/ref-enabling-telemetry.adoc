= Enabling telemetry data collection in {product-very-short}

The telemetry data collection feature is enabled by default. However, if you have disabled the feature and want to re-enable it, you must enable the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin either by using the Helm Chart or the {product} Operator configuration.
