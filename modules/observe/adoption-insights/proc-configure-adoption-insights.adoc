= Configuring the Adoption Insights plugin in {product}

The Adoption Insights plugin is preinstalled and enabled on a {product-short} instance by default. You can disable or enable the Adoption Insights plugin and change other parameters, by configuring the {product} Helm chart or the {product} Operator ConfigMap.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product} includes a built-in Adoption Insights builder that generates static HTML documentation from your codebase. However, the default basic setup of the local builder is not intended for production.
