= Configuring the Adoption Insights plugin in {product}

The Adoption Insights plugin is preinstalled and enabled on a {product-short} instance by default. You can disable or enable the Adoption Insights plugin and change other parameters, by configuring the `app-config` ConfigMap, which is created by the {product} Helm chart or Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you used the Developer Preview of the Adoption Insights plugin and configured the feature manually, you must remove those earlier configuration changes as they are no longer required.

In your dynamic plugins ConfigMap, for example: `dynamic-plugins-rhdh.yaml`, update the `package-disabled` value of the plugin to `false` as shown in the following example:

.`dynamic-plugins.yaml` fragment
[source,yaml]
----
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-analytics-provider-segment
    disabled: false
