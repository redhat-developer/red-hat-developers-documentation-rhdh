= Customizing the Adoption Insights plugin in {product}

You can customize the Adoption Insights plugin to suit your needs by disabling or re-enabling it, and adjusting other settings as needed.


[IMPORTANT]
====
If you used the developer preview of the Adoption Insights plugin and configured the feature manually, you must remove those earlier configuration changes as they are no longer required.

In your dynamic plugins ConfigMap, for example: `dynamic-plugins-rhdh.yaml`, update the `package-disabled` value of the plugin to `false` as shown in the following example:

.`dynamic-plugins.yaml` fragment
[source,yaml]
----
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-analytics-provider-segment
    disabled: false
----
====

.Procedure

* To customize `maxBufferSize`, `flushInterval`, `debug`, and `licensedUsers` in the Adoption Insights plugin, in your {product} `app-config.yaml` file, update the relevant settings as shown in the following code:
+
.`app-config.yaml` fragment
[source,terminal]
----
app:
  analytics:
    adoptionInsights: 
      maxBufferSize: _<maximum_buffer_size>_ <1>
      flushInterval: _<flush_interval>_ <2>
      debug: _<debug_value>_ <3>
      licensedUsers: _<licensed_users>_ <4>
----
<1> (Optional) Specifies the maximum buffer size for event batching. The default value is `20`. 
<2> (Optional) Specifies the flush interval in milliseconds for event batching. The default value is `5000ms`.
<3> (Optional) The default value is `false`.
<4> (Optional) Specifies the maximum number of licensed users who can access the {product-very-short} instance. The default value is `100`.

* To disable the Adoption Insights plugin, in your dynamic plugins ConfigMap, for example `dynamic-plugins-rhdh.yaml` file, update the `package.disabled` value of the plugin to `true` as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-adoption-insights
    disabled: true
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-adoption-insights-backend-dynamic
    disabled: true
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-analytics-module-adoption-insights-dynamic
    disabled: true
----

* Optional: Configure the required RBAC permission for the users who are not administrators as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
p, role:default/_<your_team>_, adoption-insights.events.read, read, allow
g, user:default/_<your_user>_, role:default/_<your_team>_
