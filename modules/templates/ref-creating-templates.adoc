= Creating a template as a YAML file

You can create a template by defining a `Template` object as a YAML file.

The `Template` object describes the template and its metadata. It also contains required input variables and a list of actions that are executed by the scaffolding service.

.`Template` object example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: template-name # <1>
  title: Example template # <2>
  description: An example template for v1beta3 scaffolder. # <3>
spec:
  owner: backstage/techdocs-core # <4>
  type: service # <5>
  parameters: # <6>
    - title: Fill in some steps
      required:
        - name
      properties:
        name:
          title: Name
          type: string
          description: Unique name of the component
        owner:
          title: Owner
          type: string
          description: Owner of the component
    - title: Choose a location
      required:
        - repoUrl
      properties:
        repoUrl:
          title: Repository Location
          type: string
  steps: # <7>
    - id: fetch-base
      name: Fetch Base
      action: fetch:template
      # ...
  output: # <8>
    links:
      - title: Repository # <9>
        url: ${{ steps['publish'].output.remoteUrl }}
      - title: Open in catalog # <10>
        icon: catalog
        entityRef: ${{ steps['register'].output.entityRef }}
# ...
----
<1> Specify a name for the template.
<2> Specify a title for the template. This is the title that is visible on the template tile in the *Create...* view.
<3> Specify a description for the template. This is the description that is visible on the template tile in the *Create...* view.
<4> Specify the ownership of the template. The `owner` field provides information about who is responsible for maintaining or overseeing the template within the system or organization. In the provided example, the `owner` field is set to `backstage/techdocs-core`. This means that this template belongs to the `techdocs-core` project in the `backstage` namespace.
<5> Specify the component type. Any string value is accepted for this required field, but your organization should establish a proper taxonomy for these. {product} instances may read this field and behave differently depending on its value. For example, a `website` type component may present tooling in the {product} interface that is specific to just websites.
+
The following values are common for this field:
+
--
`service`:: A backend service, typically exposing an API.
`website`:: A website.
`library`:: A software library, such as an npm module or a Java library.
--
<6> Use the `parameters` section to specify parameters for user input that are shown in a form view when a user creates a component by using the template in the {product} console. Each `parameters` subsection, defined by a title and properties, creates a new form page with that definition.
<7> Use the `steps` section to specify steps that are executed in the backend. These steps must be defined by using a unique step ID, a name, and an action. You can view actions that are available on your {product} instance by visiting the URL `\https://<rhdh_url>/create/actions`.
<8> Use the `output` section to specify the structure of output data that is created when the template is used. The `output` section, particularly the `links` subsection, provides valuable references and URLs that users can utilize to access and interact with components that are created from the template.
<9> Provides a reference or URL to the repository associated with the generated component.
<10> Provides a reference or URL that allows users to open the generated component in a catalog or directory where various components are listed.
