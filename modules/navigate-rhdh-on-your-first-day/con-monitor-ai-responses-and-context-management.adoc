= Monitor AI responses and context management

{ls-short} provides features to track the AI reasoning process and maintain the context of your development tasks.

Thinking cards::
An expandable thinking card appears while the AI processes a query. A pulse animation indicates the reasoning phase. You can expand the card to view detailed reasoning or collapse it to minimize screen clutter.

Tool call transparency::
An expandable card displays details for Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool calls, which allows you to monitor background processes.

Context-aware citations::
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) citations appear only when the AI uses internal documentation. This makes sure that general knowledge responses remain concise.

Context preservation during model changes::
When you select a different AI model, {ls-short} starts a new conversation. This makes sure that your previous chats remain available in your history.

Structural readability::
The interface formats headings and bullet points automatically to make sure responses are scannable.
