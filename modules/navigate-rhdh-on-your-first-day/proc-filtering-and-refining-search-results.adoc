= Filtering and refining search results

To isolate specific components, APIs, or documentation within a large software ecosystem, use the advanced search filters in {product} ({product-very-short}). Refining your search results ensures you can locate production-ready services and ownership details without navigating through unrelated resources.

.Procedure

. Enter your query in the *Search* bar in the Global Header.
. Click the *All results...* link at the bottom of the results dropdown menu.
. In the *Filters* panel, select the following options to refine the list:
** *Kind*: Filter by entity category, such as *Component*, *API*, *Template*, or *Group*.
** *Type*: Narrow the results by functional subtype, such as *service*, *library*, or *website*.
** *Lifecycle*: Isolate resources by their operational status, such as *production*, *experimental*, or *deprecated*.
. Review the filtered results to identify the description and owner of the resource.
. Optional: Use the pagination controls at the bottom of the page to navigate through large result sets.
