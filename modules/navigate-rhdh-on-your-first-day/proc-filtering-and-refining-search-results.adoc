= Filtering and refining search results

To isolate specific components, APIs, or documentation, within a large software ecosystem, use the advanced search filters in {product-very-short}. Refining your search results makes sure you can locate production-ready services and ownership details without navigating through unrelated resources.

.Procedure

. Enter a search term in the *Search* bar.
. Click *All results...*.
. In the *Filters* panel, select one or more of the following options:
* *Kind*: Filters by entity category, such as *Component*, *API*, *Template*, or *Group*.
* *Type*: Narrows the results by functional subtype, such as *service*, *library*, or *website*.
* *Lifecycle*: Isolates resources by operational status, such as *production*, *experimental*, or *deprecated*.
. Review the filtered results to identify the resource description and owner.
. Optional: Use the pagination controls to navigate the results.
