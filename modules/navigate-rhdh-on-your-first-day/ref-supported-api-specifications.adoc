= Select supported API specifications

To make sure your API definitions are discoverable and interactive within the {product} ({product-very-short}) portal, you must use a supported specification format. Selecting the appropriate format based on your service architecture allows the platform to render documentation and provide testing interfaces for other developers.

.Supported API formats

* OpenAPI: Use this standard format (formerly Swagger) for defining RESTful APIs. {product-very-short} renders these specifications into interactive documentation, allowing users to execute requests directly from the *Definition* tab.
* AsyncAPI: Use this format for event-driven architectures and message-based services. This ensures that producers and consumers can visualize message schemas and broker details within the *Software Catalog*.
* GraphQL: Use this format to define GraphQL schemas. This allows developers to explore your data graph, including queries, mutations, and types, from a centralized location.

[NOTE]
====
Support for specific formats, such as *AsyncAPI* or *GraphQL*, depends on your organization's instance configuration and enabled plugins. If a specification does not render, verify your `catalog-info.yaml` metadata or contact your platform administrator.
