= Analyzing microservice dependencies in the Software Catalog

To identify backend applications and microservices, view their deployment status, and understand their API relationships, use the filters in the {product} ({product-very-short}) Software Catalog. Filtering for services makes sure you can verify architectural connections and ownership without manually tracing code across disparate repositories.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the {product-very-short} interface.
. In the left navigation sidebar, click *Catalog*. 
. Click the *Kind* filter and select *Component*. 
. Click the *Type* filter and select *Service*. 
. Optional: Narrow the list by selecting a specific *Owner* or *Lifecycle*, such as `production` or `experimental`. 
. Select a service card to open the detailed entity view.
. Review the *Overview* tab to identify the assigned owner and access links to the source code repository.
. Select the *Dependencies* or *Relations* tab to see upstream and downstream connections for that service.
