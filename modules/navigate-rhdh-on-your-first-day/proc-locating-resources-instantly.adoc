= Locating resources instantly

To bypass menu navigation and locate technical assets quickly, use the universal search bar in {product} ({product-very-short}). The search engine provides real-time suggestions to help you navigate directly to services, documentation, or team members, which reduces the time spent searching across disparate repositories.

.Procedure

. Click the *Search* input field in the Global Header.
. Enter your query, such as a service name, API endpoint, or technical concept.
. Review the instant results in the dropdown menu, which categorize matches by entity types such as *Components*, *APIs*, *TechDocs*, and *Users*.
. Select a suggestion from the list to navigate directly to that resource.
