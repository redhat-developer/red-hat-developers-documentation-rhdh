= Overview of the onboarding workflow

To begin using {product-very-short}, you must verify your access permissions, confirm software entity ownership, and personalize your interface. After you complete these initial tasks, you can locate team services and use self-service capabilities.

.Log in and verify your profile

Your first step will be to confirm you are logged in as the correct user and that the platform recognizes your identity.

* *Authenticate*: Access your organization's {product-very-short} URL and log in using your corporate credentials.

* *Check your identity*: Click your avatar or name in the Global Header and select *Settings*. Verify that the *User Entity* matches your corporate identity.

* *Verify Ownership*: Navigate to *My Profile* from the user menu. Check the *Ownership* card to ensure it lists the components, APIs, and systems you or your team are responsible for. If this list is empty, you might need to register your ownership in the Software Catalog.

// For more information, see Log in (Section 2), get the link once published.

.Organize your workspace

To reduce navigation time across the software ecosystem, curate a list of high-priority resources.

* *Star your services*: Locate your frequently used components in the *Catalog* and select the *Star* icon to add them to your favorites.
* *Access starred items*: Use the *Starred Items* menu in the Global Header to open your favorite resources quickly.
* *Pin the Sidebar*: Use this if you switch frequently between tools. The sidebar is pinned by default. To unpin the sidebar, go to *Settings* and disable *Pin Sidebar*. See [Personalizing the navigation experience in {product-very-short}].

// For more information, see Managing starred items for quick access.

.Explore production resources

Production instances provide access to live infrastructure data and technical guides required for operational tasks.

* *See production documentation*: Use the *Docs* menu to find production-specific documentation, such as runbooks or deployment guides linked to your components. See [Searching for relevant content in Technical Documentation (TechDocs)].
* *Check production APIs*: Navigate to the *APIs* page to confirm that production endpoint definitions are accurate and discoverable. See [Verify API contracts before integrating with backend services].
* *Test Self-Service templates*: Click *Create* (+) in the Global Header to examine available Software Templates. Confirm that you have access to the Software Templates required to generate new production services. See [Import and use an existing Software Template for faster development].
