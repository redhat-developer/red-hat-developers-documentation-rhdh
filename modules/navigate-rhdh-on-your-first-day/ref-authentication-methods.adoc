= Authentication methods to enable self-service capabilities

To access the specific tools, repositories, and permissions assigned to your role, you must authenticate to {product} ({product-very-short}) using a supported provider. Selecting the correct authentication method ensures that the portal correctly associates your identity with your team's software components and self-service capabilities.

.Common authentication methods:

Corporate Single Sign-On (SSO)::
Select this option to use your standard organizational credentials. This method typically provides full access to internal resources and links your portal identity to your official team membership.

Federated authentication::
Use services such as *Keycloak* or *Ping Federate* to unify your login across multiple enterprise applications. This ensures that your permissions remain consistent as you navigate between the portal and external development tools.

OAuth providers::
Select providers such as GitHub, GitLab, or *Azure DevOps* to link your developer identity directly to the portal. This is required if you need to perform actions in the *Software Catalog* that involve external version control systems.

Guest access::
Use this restricted, read-only mode for initial platform exploration.
