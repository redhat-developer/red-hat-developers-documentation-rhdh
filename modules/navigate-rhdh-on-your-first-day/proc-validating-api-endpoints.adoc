= Testing API endpoints interactively

To verify API behavior and debug service responses, use the interactive test interface in {product} ({product-very-short}). Validating endpoints directly within the portal makes sure they return the expected status codes and data models, which eliminates the need to configure external testing tools during the initial integration phase.

.Prerequisites

* You have the required credentials or tokens if the API requires authentication.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the specific API you must validate and select the *Definition* tab.
. Locate the operation you want to verify and select the header to expand the details.
. Click *Try it out* to enable the interactive input fields.
. Enter the required parameters or the request body JSON in the provided fields.
. Click *Execute*.
. Examine the *Server response* section to verify the status code, response body, and headers.

[NOTE]
====
If you receive 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) errors, you must verify your credentials with the API owner or check the authorization header requirements in the specification.
