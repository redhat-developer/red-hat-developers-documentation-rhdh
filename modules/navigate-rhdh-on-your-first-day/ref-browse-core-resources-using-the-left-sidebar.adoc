= Browse core resources using the left sidebar

To discover tools, manage catalogs, and access technical documentation without switching contexts, use the left navigation sidebar in {product} ({product-very-short}). The sidebar organizes platform resources into functional sections that allow you to locate the specific services and APIs required for your development tasks.

.Standard navigation items

Home::
Navigate to your personalized dashboard to view recently accessed resources, team activity, and tailored quickstart guides.

Catalog::
Access the centralized inventory of all software assets. Use this section to browse and filter components, services, and systems to understand their ownership and operational health.

Docs::
Access the *TechDocs* library to read technical guides and runbooks that are synchronized with the source code of your organization's services.

APIs::
Discover and test API definitions. Use this section to inspect OpenAPI or AsyncAPI specifications and verify endpoints directly in the browser.

Administration::
(Restricted) Access platform configuration tools. This section is visible primarily to platform engineers for managing users, permissions, and plugin settings.

.Extended sidebar items

As your organization enables additional plugins to support your workflow, more items might appear in the sidebar:

* *Learning Paths*: Access training modules and educational resources to develop new technical skills.
* *Tech Radar*: Review your organization's official technology recommendations and standards.
* *Cost Insights*: Monitor the cloud infrastructure costs associated with your specific services or teams.
