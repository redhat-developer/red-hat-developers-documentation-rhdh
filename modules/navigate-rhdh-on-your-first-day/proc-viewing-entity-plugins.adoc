. In the left navigation sidebar, click *Catalog*.
. Select a *Component* or *Service* card.
. Review the tabs at the top of the entity page to view configured plugins:
* *CI/CD*: Displays build status and history from tools such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
* *Kubernetes*: Shows deployment status and pod health.
* *Topology*: Visualizes the relationships and status of running resources.

.Next steps
