= Creating a basic Software Template

To automate the setup of standardized environments for your developers, you must create a template definition. This definition allows {product-very-short} to automate the repetitive tasks of repository creation and initial configuration.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator access to a {product-very-short} instance.
* You have a Git repository to store Software Template files.

.Procedure

. Create a directory in your Git repository for the Software Template.
. Create a file named `template.yaml` in that directory.
. In the `template.yaml` file, define the `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` to identify the starter kit in the software catalog.
. Add a `spec` section to define the `parameters` that a developer must provide when they use the Software Template.
. Define the `steps` required to generate the project, such as `fetch:template` to retrieve the skeleton and `publish:github` to create the new repository.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must include TechDocs in your Software Templates to ensure that documentation is automatically generated for every new project created from the Software Template.
====

.Verification

. Inspect the `template.yaml` file to ensure the YAML syntax is valid.
. Confirm that the `name` and `action` fields are defined so the template is correctly recognized as a Scaffolder task.
. Check that the defined `parameters` match the variables used in your Software Template skeleton files.
. Navigate to the form playground at `<instance-url>/create/template-form` and test the Software Template configuration to confirm the fields and logic render as intended.
