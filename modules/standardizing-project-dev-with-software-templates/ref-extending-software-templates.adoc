= Extending Software Templates for complex project requirements

To handle varied project requirements and create dynamic developer experiences, you can use advanced logic in your template definitions. These capabilities allow your templates to adapt to different environments and user inputs. The following table depicts the goals for advanced templating:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Description
| *Parameterization* | Use variables to inject user-provided data into project files.
| *Conditional Logic* | Execute specific automation steps only when certain conditions are met.
| *Fetch and Execute* | Retrieve remote files and run commands during the setup process.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must include TechDocs in your Software Templates to ensure that documentation is automatically generated for every new project created from the Software Template.
