= Software Templates in {product}

To enable developers to create new projects independently while maintaining organizational standards, you can use Software Templates in {product-name}. These templates, part of the {backstage} "Scaffolder" system, automate the project setup process to reduce manual configuration and errors.

A Software Template consists of a YAML file that defines the following elements to complete the setup job:

* *Metadata*: Metadata that names and describes the template so developers can find the correct starter kit in the catalog.
* *Parameters*: Parameters that define the specific information developers must provide, such as the project name or owner.
* *Steps*: A sequence of steps that the system performs to build the project, such as fetching a repository skeleton, injecting parameters, and publishing the code to a Git provider.
