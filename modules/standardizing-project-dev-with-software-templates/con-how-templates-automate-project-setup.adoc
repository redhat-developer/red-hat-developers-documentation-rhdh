= Software Templates in {product}

You can use Software Templates in {product-very-short} to automate the project setup process to reduce manual configuration and errors for developers. These Software Templates are part of the {backstage} Scaffolder system.

A Software Template consists of a YAML file with the following elements:

* *Metadata*: Names and describes the template so developers can find the correct starter kit in the catalog
* *Parameters*: Define the specific information developers must provide, such as the project name or owner
* *Steps*: Sequence of steps that the system performs to build the project, such as fetching a repository skeleton, injecting parameters, and publishing the code to a Git provider
