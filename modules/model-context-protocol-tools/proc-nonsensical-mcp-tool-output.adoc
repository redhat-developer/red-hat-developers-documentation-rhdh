= Resolve nonsensical MCP tool output

Nonsensical output often occurs when smaller models or models with smaller context sizes cannot effectively manage repeated tool calls within the same context window.

.Procedure

To improve the quality of the tool output, take the following actions:

. Select an appropriate model for tool calling.
.. Verify that the model has good support for tool calling.
.. Make sure your model is not too small. We recommend a model with at least 7 billion parameters and a context window of 32k.
. Refine your queries.
.. Use more well-defined queries that limit the amount of data returned in the response from the tool.
. If possible, increase the context window size of the model. We recommend at least 32k for these MCP tools.
