= Resolving the `Model does not support tool calling` error

This error indicates that the model configured in your MCP client lacks the required functionality to handle tool calls. The error message appears similar to: `Invalid request: model gemma3:27b does not support tool calls`.

.Procedure

. Consult your model documentation to confirm its support for tool calling.
. If the current model does not support tool calling, change the model that your MCP client uses to a tool-calling compatible model.
