include::{docdir}/artifacts/snip-developer-preview-mcp.adoc[]

*Model Context Protocol* (*MCP*) connects AI models and applications (*MCP clients*) to external systems (*MCP servers*) to access information and workflows. *MCP servers* define the tools that MCP clients can interact with. {product} ({product-very-short}) supports MCP tools through the `mcp-actions-backend` plugin available in {backstage} 1.40 or later. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must verify that your model supports tool calling before you enable Model Context Protocol (MCP) features. Using an incompatible model results in error messages.
