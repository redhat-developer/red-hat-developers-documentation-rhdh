= Measuring documentation gaps using `analyze-techdocs-coverage`

The `analyze-techdocs-coverage` TechDocs MCP tool calculates the percentage of entities that have TechDocs configured. Use this tool to identify documentation gaps and improve overall documentation coverage.

You can filter results by the following entity attributes:
* `type`
* `namespace`
* `owner`
* `lifecycle`
* `tags`
By default, `analyze-techdocs-coverage` returns a JSON entity that includes the `totalEntities`, `entitiesWithDocs`, and `coveragePercentage` fields.

The following examples show common queries:

* “What is the coverage of techdocs in the backstage server”
* “What is the coverage of techdocs in the default namespace”
