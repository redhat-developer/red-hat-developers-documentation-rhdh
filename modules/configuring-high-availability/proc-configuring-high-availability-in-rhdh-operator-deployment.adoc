= Configuring High availability in a {product} Operator deployment

{product-very-short} instances that are deployed with the Operator use configurations in the `{product-custom-resource-type}` custom resource. In the `{product-custom-resource-type}` custom resource, the default value for the `replicas` field is `1`. If you want to configure your {product-very-short} instance for high availability, you must set `replicas` to a value greater than `1`.


.Procedure
