= Installing and configuring a third-party TechDocs add-on

You can install compatible third-party TechDocs add-on on your {product} instance as a front-end dynamic plugin.

.Prerequisites
* The third-party TechDocs add-on has a valid `package.json` file in its root directory, containing all required metadata and dependencies.
* The third-party plugin is packaged as a dynamic plugin in an OCI image. For alternative package types, see link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/red-hat-developers-documentation-rhdh/release-1.5/plugins-rhdh-install/#assembly-install-third-party-plugins-rhdh[Installing third-party plugins in {product}].
* You have installed the `yarn` package manager.
* The third-party plugin is packaged as a dynamic plugin in an OCI image.* You have installed and configured Node.js and NPM.

.Procedure
. Install the third-party plugin that you want to use to import your third-party add-on by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
yarn install
----
. Obtain the source code for the third-party TechDocs add-on that you want to use.
. Export the TechDocs add-on as a dynamic plugin using the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
npx @red-hat-developer-hub/cli@latest plugin export
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `@latest` tag pulls the latest version of the @red-hat-developer-hub/cli package, which is compatible with the most recent features and fixes. Use a version that is compatible with your {product} version.
====
. To package the third-party TechDocs add-on as a dynamic plugin, navigate to the root directory where the plugin is stored (not the dist-dynamic directory) and run the `npx` command with the `--tag` option to specify the image name and tag. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
npx @red-hat-developer-hub/cli@latest plugin package --tag quay.io/_<user_name>_/_<techdocs_add-on_image>_:latest
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The output of the package-dynamic-plugins command provides the file path to the plugin for use in the `dynamic-plugin-config.yaml` file.
====
+
. To publish the third-party TechDocs add-on to a Quay repository, push the image to a registry using one of the following commands, depending on your virtualization tool:
* To use `podman`, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
podman push quay.io/_<user_name>_/_<techdocs_add-on_image>_:latest
----
* To use `docker`, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
docker push quay.io/_<user_name>_/_<techdocs_add-on_image>_:latest
----
. Open your `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file to view or modify the configuration for the third-party TechDocs add-on. For example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
plugins:
      - package: oci://quay.io/_<user_name>_/_<techdocs_add-on_image>_:latest!_<techdocs_add-on_package>_
        disabled: false
        pluginConfig:
