= Configuration of permission policies administrators

The permission policies for users and groups in the {product-short} are managed by permission policy administrators. Only permission policy administrators can access the Role-Based Access Control REST API.

The purpose of configuring policy administrators is to enable a specific, restricted number of authenticated users to access the RBAC REST API. The permission policies are defined in a `policy.csv` file, which is referenced in the `app-config-rhdh` ConfigMap. OpenShift platform administrators or cluster administrators can perform this task with access to the namespace where {product} is deployed.

You can set the credentials of a permission policy administrator in the `app-config.yaml` file as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    admin:
      users:
        - name: user:default/joeuser
----
