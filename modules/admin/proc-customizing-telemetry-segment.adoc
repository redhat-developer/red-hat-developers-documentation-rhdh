= Customizing telemetry Segment source


The `analytics-provider-segment` plugin sends the collected telemetry data to {company-name} by default. However, you can configure a new Segment source that receives telemetry data based on your needs. For configuration, you need a unique Segment write key that points to the Segment source.

[NOTE]
====
By configuring a new Segment source, you can collect and analyze the same set of data that is mentioned in the link:{LinkAdminGuide}#assembly-rhdh-telemetry_admin-rhdh[Telemetry data collection] section. You might also require to create your own telemetry data collection notice for your application users.
