= Understanding the `NO_PROXY` exclusion rules

`NO_PROXY` is a comma or space-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses, optionally with port numbers. If the input URL matches any of the entries listed in `NO_PROXY`, then that URL will be fetched by a direct request (i.e., bypassing the proxy settings).

Note that the default value for `NO_PROXY` in {product-very-short} is `localhost,127.0.0.1`. If you want to override it, please make sure to also include at least `localhost` or `localhost:7007` in the list; otherwise, the {product-very-short} Backend may not work correctly.

Matching follows the rules below:

* `NO_PROXY=*` will bypass the proxy for all requests.

* Space and commas may be used to separate the entries in the `NO_PROXY` list. For example, `NO_PROXY=localhost,example.com`, `NO_PROXY="localhost example.com"`, or `NO_PROXY="localhost, example.com"` would have the same effect.

* If `NO_PROXY` does not contain any entries, then all requests will be sent through the proxy if the `HTTP(S)_PROXY` settings are configured. Otherwise, requests will be fetched directly.

* No DNS lookup is performed to decide if a request should bypass the proxy or not. For example, if DNS is known to resolve `example.com` to `1.2.3.4`, setting `NO_PROXY=1.2.3.4` will not have any effect on requests sent to `example.com`. Only requests explicitly sent to the IP address `1.2.3.4` will bypass the proxy.

* If a port is added after the hostname or IP Address, then the input request must match both the host/IP and port in order to bypass the proxy. For example, `NO_PROXY=example.com:1234` would exclude requests to `http(s)://example.com:1234` (so calling them directly), but not requests to other ports like `http(s)://example.com` (which will be sent through the proxy).

* If no port is specified after the hostname or IP address, all requests to that host/IP address will bypass the proxy regardless of the port. For example, `NO_PROXY=localhost` would exclude all requests sent to `localhost` (so calling them directly), like `http(s)://localhost:7077` and `http(s)://localhost:8888`.

* IP Address blocks in CIDR notation will not work. So setting `NO_PROXY=10.11.0.0/16` will not have any effect, even if a request is explicitly sent to an IP address in that block.

* Only IPv4 addresses are supported. IPv6 addresses like `::1` will not work.

* Generally, the proxy is only bypassed if the hostname is an exact match for an entry in the `NO_PROXY` list. The only exceptions are entries that start with a dot (`.`) or with a wildcard (`*`). In such a case, the proxy is bypassed if the hostname ends with the entry. Please note that you should list both the domain and the wildcard domain if you want to exclude a given domain and all its subdomains. For example, you would set `NO_PROXY=example.com,.example.com` to bypass the proxy for requests sent to `http(s)://example.com` and `http(s)://subdomain.example.com`.
