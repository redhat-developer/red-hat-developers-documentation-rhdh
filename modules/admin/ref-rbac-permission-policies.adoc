= Permission policies in {product}

Permission policies in {product} are a set of rules to govern access to resources or functionalities. These policies state the authorization level that is granted to users based on their roles. The permission policies are implemented to maintain security and confidentiality within a given environment.

You can define two types of permissions in {product-short} including, resource type and basic permissions. 

There are two types of permissions available in {product-short} including, resource type and basic permissions. The distinction between the two permission types depends on whether a permission includes a defined resource type.

You can define the resource type permission using either the associated resource type of the permission name. The following is an example of resource type permission definition:

.Example resource type permission definition
[source,csv]
----
p, role:default/myrole, catalog.entity.read, read, allow
g, user:default/myuser, role:default/myrole

p, role:default/another-role, catalog-entity, read, allow
g, user:default/another-user, role:default/another-role
----
