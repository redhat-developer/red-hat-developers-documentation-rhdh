= Installing the {product} Operator

As an administrator, you can install the {product} Operator. Authorized users can use the Operator to install {product} on the following platforms:

* {ocp-brand-name} ({ocp-very-short})
* {eks-brand-name} ({eks-short})
* {aks-brand-name} ({aks-short})

{ocp-very-short} is currently supported from version {ocp-version-min} to {ocp-version}. See also the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/developerhub[Red Hat Developer Hub Life Cycle].

Containers are available for the following CPU architectures:

* AMD64 and Intel 64 (x86_64)

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in as an administrator on the {ocp-short} web console.
* You have configured the appropriate roles and permissions within your project to create an application. For more information, see the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/applications/index.html[Red Hat OpenShift documentation on Building applications].

[NOTE]
====
For enhanced security, deploy the {product} Operator in a dedicated default namespace such as `rhdh-operator`. The cluster administrator can restrict other users' access to the Operator resources through role bindings or cluster role bindings.
====

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the {ocp-short} web console, navigate to *Operators > OperatorHub*.
. In the *Filter by keyword* box, enter {product-short} and click the *{product}* Operator card.
. On the *{product} Operator* page, click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page, use the *Update channel* drop-down menu to select the update channel that you want to use:
** The *fast* channel provides y-stream (x.y) and z-stream (x.y.z) updates, for example, updating from version 1.1 to 1.2, or from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `fast` channel includes all of the updates available for a particular version. Any update might introduce unexpected changes in your {product} deployment. Check the release notes for details about any potentially breaking changes.
====

** The *fast-1.1* channel only provides z-stream updates, for example, updating from version 1.1.1 to 1.1.2. If you want to update the {product} y-version in the future, for example, updating from 1.1 to 1.2, you must switch to the *fast* channel manually.

. On the *Install Operator* page, choose the *Update approval* strategy for the Operator:
** If you choose the *Automatic* option, the Operator is updated without requiring manual confirmation.
** If you choose the *Manual* option, a notification opens when a new update is released in the update channel. The update must be manually approved by an administrator before installation can begin.

. Click *Install*.

.Verification

* To view the installed {product} Operator, click *View Operator*.
