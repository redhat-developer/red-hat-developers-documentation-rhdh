= Enabling telemetry data collection in {product-very-short}

The telemetry data collection feature is enabled by default. However, if you have disabled the feature and want to re-enable it, you must enable the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin either by using the Helm Chart or the {product} Operator configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin is already present in your dynamic plugins configuration, set the value of the `plugins.disabled` parameter to `false` to enable telemetry data collection. You can do the same when you upgrade your Helm release by using the *Helm* View of the *Developer* perspective.
