= Disabling telemetry data collection in {product-very-short}

To disable telemetry data collection, you must disable the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin either using the Helm Chart or the {product} Operator configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin is already present in your dynamic plugins configuration, set the value of the `plugins.disabled` parameter to `true` to disable telemetry data collection. You can do the same when you upgrade your Helm release by using the *Helm* View of the *Developer* perspective.
