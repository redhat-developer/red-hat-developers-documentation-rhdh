= Mounting directories from pre-created PVCs

Starting from `v1alpha3`, you can mount directories from pre-created PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) using the `spec.application.extraFiles.pvcs` field.

.Prerequisites
* You have understanding of the mounting logic:
** If `spec.application.extraFiles.pvcs[].mountPath` is defined, the PVC is mounted to the specified path.
** If `spec.application.extraFiles.pvcs[].mountPath` is not defined, the PVC is mounted under the path specified in `spec.application.extraFiles.mountPath/`.
** If `mountPath` is not defined, the PVC defaults to `/opt/app-root/src`, or you can use the {product-very-short} container's working directory if it is specified.

.Procedure
. Define the PVCs using the following YAML example:

kind: PersistentVolumeClaim  
metadata:  
  name: myclaim1

. Use the following configuration to specify how the PVCs are mounted in the container:

  application:  
    extraFiles:  
      mountPath: /my/path  
      pvcs:  
        - name: myclaim1  
        - name: myclaim2  
          mountPath: /vol/my/claim

.Verification
Based on the configuration, the following directories are mounted in the container:

* `/my/path/myclaim1`
* `/vol/my/claim`
