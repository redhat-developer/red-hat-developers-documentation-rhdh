== Using a dedicated service to provide data to the Learning Paths

When using a dedicated service, you can do the following:

* Use the same service to provide the data to all configurable {product-short} pages or use a different service for each page.
* Use the https://github.com/redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider[`red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider`] as an example service, which provides data for both the Home and Tech Radar pages. The `red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider` service provides the same data as default {product-short} data. You can fork the `red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider` service repository from GitHub and modify it with your own data, if required.
* Deploy the `red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider` service and the {product-short} Helm chart on the same cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {product} using Helm chart.

.Procedure

To use a dedicated service to provide the Learning Path data, complete the following steps:

. Add the following code to the link:{configuring-book-url}[`{my-app-config-file}` file]:
+
[source,yaml]
----
   proxy:
      endpoints:
        # Other Proxies
        '/developer-hub/learning-paths':
          target: ${LEARNING_PATH_DATA_URL}
          changeOrigin: true
          # Change to "false" in case of using self hosted cluster with a self-signed certificate
          secure: true
----
where the `LEARNING_PATH_DATA_URL` is defined as `pass:c[http://<SERVICE_NAME>/learning-paths]`, for example, `pass:c[http://rhdh-customization-provider/learning-paths]`.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can define the `LEARNING_PATH_DATA_URL` by adding it to `rhdh-secrets` or by directly replacing it with its value in your custom ConfigMap.
====
+
. Delete the {product-short} pod to ensure that the new configurations are loaded correctly.
