= Customizing the Learning Paths by using a hosted JSON file

For ease of use and simplicity, you can configure the Learning Paths by using a hosted JSON file.

.Procedure
. Publish the JSON file containing your Learning Paths data to a web server, such as GitHub or Gitlab. You can find an example at link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/rhdh/main/packages/app/public/learning-paths/data.json[].

. Configure the {product-short} proxy to access the Learning Paths data from the hosted JSON file, by adding the following code to the `{my-app-config-file}` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
proxy:
  endpoints:
    '/developer-hub':
      target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
      pathRewrite:
        '^/api/proxy/developer-hub/learning-paths': '/redhat-developer/rhdh/main/packages/app/public/learning-paths/data.json'
      changeOrigin: true
      secure: true
----
+
[TIP]
====
When also configuring the home page, due to the use of overlapping `pathRewrites` for both the `learning-path` and `homepage` quick access proxies, create the `learning-paths` configuration (`^api/proxy/developer-hub/learning-paths`) before you create the `homepage` configuration (`^/api/proxy/developer-hub`).
For example:

[source,yaml]
----
proxy:
  endpoints:
    '/developer-hub':
      target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
      pathRewrite:
        '^/api/proxy/developer-hub/learning-paths': '/redhat-developer/rhdh/main/packages/app/public/learning-paths/data.json'
        '^/api/proxy/developer-hub/tech-radar': '/redhat-developer/rhdh/main/packages/app/public/tech-radar/data-default.json'
        '^/api/proxy/developer-hub': '/redhat-developer/rhdh/main/packages/app/public/homepage/data.json'
      changeOrigin: true
      secure: true
