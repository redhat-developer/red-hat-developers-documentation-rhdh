= Data handoff and custom workflow design

When you configure the Bulk Import plugin by setting the importAPI field to `scaffolder`, the Bulk Import Backend passes all necessary context directly to the Scaffolder API.

As an administrator, you can define the Scaffolder template workflow and structure the workflow to do the following:

Define template parameters to consume input:: Structure the Scaffolder template to receive the repository data as template parameters for the current workflow run. The template must be generic, and not specific to a single repository, so that it can successfully run for every repository in the bulk list.

Automate processing for each repository:: Implement the custom logic needed for a single repository within the template. The Orchestrator iterates through the repository list, launching the template once for each repository and passes only the data for that single repository to the template run. This allows you to automate tasks such as creating the `catalog-info.yaml`, running compliance checks, or registering the entity with the catalog.
