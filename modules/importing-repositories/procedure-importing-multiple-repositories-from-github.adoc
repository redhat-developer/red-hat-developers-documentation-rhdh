= Importing multiple GitHub repositories

In {product}, you can select your GitHub repositories and automate their onboarding to the {product-short} catalog.

.Prerequisites
* You have link:{authentication-book-url}#enabling-authentication-with-github[configured GitHub authentication and integration].
* You have xref:enabling-and-giving-access-to-the-bulk-import-feature[enabled the Bulk Import feature and gave access to it].

.Procedure
. Click *Bulk Import* in the left sidebar.
. Click the *Add* button in the top-right corner to see the list of all repositories accessible from the configured GitHub integrations.
.. From the *Repositories* view, you can select any repository, or search for any accessible repositories.
For each repository selected, a `catalog-info.yaml` is generated.
.. From the *Organizations* view, you can select any organization by clicking *Select* in the third column.
This option allows you to select one or more repositories from the selected organization.
. Click *Preview file* to view or edit the details of the pull request for each repository.
.. Review the pull request description and the `catalog-info.yaml` file content.
.. Optional: when the repository has a `.github/CODEOWNERS` file, you can select the *Use CODEOWNERS file as Entity Owner* checkbox to use it, rather than having the `content-info.yaml` contain a specific entity owner.
.. Click *Save*.
. Click *Create pull requests*.
At this point, a set of dry-run checks runs against the selected repositories to ensure they meet the requirements for import, such as:
.. Verifying that there is no entity in the {product-short} catalog with the name specified in the repository `catalog-info.yaml`
.. Verifying that the repository is not empty
.. Verifying that the repository contains a `.github/CODEOWNERS` file if the *Use CODEOWNERS file as Entity Owner* checkbox is selected for that repository

** If any errors occur, the pull requests are not created, and you see a _Failed to create PR_ error message detailing the issues.
To view more details about the reasons, click *Edit*.

** If there are no errors, the pull requests are created, and you are redirected to the list of added repositories.

. Review and merge each pull request that creates a `catalog-info.yml` file.

.Verification
* The *Added repositories* list displays the repositories you imported, each with an appropriate status: either _Waiting for approval_ or _Added_.
* For each _Waiting for approval_ import job listed, there is a corresponding pull request adding the `catalog-info.yaml` file in the corresponding repository.
