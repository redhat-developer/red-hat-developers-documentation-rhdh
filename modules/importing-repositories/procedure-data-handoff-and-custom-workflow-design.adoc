= Data handoff and custom workflow design

When you configure the Bulk Import plugin by setting the importAPI field to `scaffolder`, the Bulk Import Backend passed all necessary context directly to the Scaffolder API.

As an administrator, you can define the Scaffolder template workflow and structure the workflow to do the following:

Define template parameters to consume input:: Structure the Scaffolder template to receive the repository data as template parameters for the current workflow run. The template must be generic, and not specific to a single repository, so that it can successfully run for every repository in the bulk list.

Automate processing for each repository:: Implement the custom logic needed for a single repository within the template. The Orchestrator iterates through the repository list, launching the template once for each repository and passes only the data for that single repository to the template run. This allows you to automate tasks like creating the `catalog-info.yaml`, running compliance checks, or registering the entity with the catalog.

Centralize import workflow management:: Use the Scaffolder template to define and manage the entire import lifecycle for the repository list, providing you with a single point of management and traceability for the bulk operation. This method offers greater flexibility in defining the import scenario.
