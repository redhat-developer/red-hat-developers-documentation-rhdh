= Data handoff and custom workflow design

When you configure the Bulk Import plugin by setting the importAPI field to `scaffolder`, the Bulk Import Backend ensures all necessary context is passed directly to the Scaffolder API.

Your control over input data:: The Orchestrator workflow receives the input data required to automate processing for every selected repository. For each repository in that list, the bulk import launches the scaffolder template once and passes the data for that single repository to the template run.

As an administrator, you can define the Scaffolder template workflow and structure the workflow to do the following:

Consume the input:: The Scaffolder template receives the repository data as template parameters for the current execution.

Iterate and process:: The orchestrator handles iterating through the repository list and launches the template for each repository. Within a single template run, implement the custom logic for that single repository. For example, create the `catalog-info.yaml` if needed, run compliance checks, then register with the catalog.

Manage lifecycle:: The Scaffolder template workflow owns the entire import lifecycle for the repository list, providing a single point of management and traceability.
