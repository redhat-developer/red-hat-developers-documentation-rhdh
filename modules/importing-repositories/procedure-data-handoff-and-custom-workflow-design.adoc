= Data handoff and custom workflow design

When you configure the Bulk Import plugin by setting the importAPI field to `scaffolder`, the Bulk Import Backend ensures all necessary context is passed directly to the Scaffolder API.

Your control over input data:: The Orchestrator workflow receives the input data required to automate processing for every selected repository. The payload includes, at minimum, the complete list of repository URLs and the user identity.

As an administrator, you can define the Scaffolder template workflow and structure the workflow to do the following:

Consume the input:: Accept the repositories array as primary input.

Iterate and process:: Loop through the list, executing the custom logic for example, creating the `catalog-info.yaml` if needed, then running compliance checks, then registering with the catalog.

Manage lifecycle:: The Scaffolder template workflow owns the entire import lifecycle for the repository list, providing a single point of management and traceability.
