= Managing the list of Added repositories

.Prerequisites
* xref:enabling-ang-giving-access-to-the-bulk-import-feature[You enabled the Bulk Import feature].
* xref:enabling-ang-giving-access-to-the-bulk-import-feature[Your {product-short} user has access to the Bulk Import feature].


.Procedure
. Click on *Bulk Import* in the left sidebar to display all the current repositories that are being tracked as Import jobs, along with their status.

Added:: The repository has been added to the Developer Hub catalog.
This can be the case after the import PR has been merged, or if the repository already had a `catalog-info.yaml` when it was bulk-imported.
Please note that it might take a few minutes until the entities are available in the catalog.

Waiting for approval:: There is an open pull request adding a `catalog-info.yaml`.
You can:
* Click on the *pencil icon* on the right to see details about this pull request or edit the pull request content right from {product-short}.
* Delete the Import job, in which case the import PR will be closed as well.
* To transition the Import job to the _Added_ state, merge the import pull request from the Git repository.

Empty:: {product-short} was not able to determine the Import job status.
This can be the case if the repository was imported from other sources but does not have any `catalog-info.yaml` file and does not have any import PR adding it.

[NOTE]
====
* After an import pull request is merged, the Import status will be _Added_ in the list of Added Repositories, but it might take a few seconds until the corresponding entities show up in the Developer Hub Catalog.
* A Location added through other sources (like statically in an `app-config.yaml` file, dynamically when link:{linkgettingstartedguide}#enabling-github-discovery-in-red-hat-developer-hub[enabling GitHub discovery], or registered manually via the "Register an existing component" page) may show up in the Bulk Import list of Added Repositories if both conditions are met:
** The target repository is accessible from the configured GitHub integrations.
** The Location URL points to a `catalog-info.yaml` file at the root of the repository default branch.
