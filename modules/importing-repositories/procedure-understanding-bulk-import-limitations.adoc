= Bulk Import limitations

* Only the first 20 repositories (in alphabetical order) can be displayed at most on the Added Repositories page.
Also, the count of Added Repositories displayed might be wrong.
In future releases, we plan to address this with proper pagination.
Meanwhile, as a workaround, searching would still work against all Added Repositories.
So you can still search any Added Repository and get it listed on the table.
See https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-4067[RHIDP-4067].

* Repositories might be added to {product-short} from various sources (like statically in an app-config file or dynamically when link:{linkgettingstartedguide}#enabling-github-discovery-in-red-hat-developer-hub[enabling GitHub discovery]).
By design, the bulk import plugin will only track repositories that are accessible from the configured GitHub integrations.
However, deleting a repository from the Bulk Imports listing page may not work if the repository was discovered by the GitHub discovery plugin.
See https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-3931[RHIDP-3931].
