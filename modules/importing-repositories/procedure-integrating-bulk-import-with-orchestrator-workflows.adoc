= Setting up a custom Scaffolder workflow for Bulk Import

As an administrator, you can create a custom Scaffolder template in line with the repository conventions of your organization and add the template into the {product} catalog for use by the Bulk Import plugin on multiple selected repositories.

You can define various custom tasks, including, but not limited to the following:

* Importing existing catalog entities from a repository
* Creating pull requests for cleanup
* Calling webhooks for external system integration

.Prerequisites

* You created a custom Scaffolder template for the Bulk Import plugin.

* For the {product-very-short} instance to use the Scaffolder functionality, you must run it with the following environment variable enabled:
+
[source,yaml]
----
export NODE_OPTIONS=--no-node-snapshot
----

.Procedure

* Configure your {my-app-config-file} configuration to instruct the Bulk Import plugin to use your custom template.
+
To configure the Bulk Import workflow:
+
[source,yaml]
----
bulkImport:
  importTemplate: <your_template_entity_reference_or_template_name>
  importAPI: `open-pull-requests` | `scaffolder`;
----
+
where:

`importTemplate:`::
Enter your Scaffolder template entity reference.

`importAPI`::
Set the API to 'scaffolder' to trigger the defined workflow for high-fidelity automation. This field defines the import workflow and currently supports two following options:

`open-pull-requests`:: This is the default import workflow, which includes the logic for creating pull requests for every selected repository.

`scaffolder`:: This workflow uses an import scenario defined in the Scaffolder template to create import jobs. Select this option to use the custom import scenario defined in your Scaffolder template.

Optional: You can direct the Bulk Import plugin to hand off the entire list of selected repositories to a custom Orchestrator workflow.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Scaffolder template must be generic and not specific to a single repository if you want your custom Scaffolder template to run successfully for every repository in the bulk list.
====

.Verification

* The Bulk Import plugin runs the custom Scaffolder template for the list of repositories using the `/task-imports` API endpoint.
