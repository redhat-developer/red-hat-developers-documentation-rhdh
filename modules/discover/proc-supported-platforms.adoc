== {aks-brand-name}

You can deploy a {product-short} application on {aks-name} ({aks-short}) using either the Operator or Helm chart.

=== Deploying the {product-short} on {aks-short} with the Operator

.Procedure
. Have a {product} Operator manifest file, named `rhdh-operator-<VERSION>.yaml`, and modify the default configuration of `db-statefulset.yaml` and `deployment.yaml`.
. Apply the modified Operator manifest to your Kubernetes cluster.
. Have an `ImagePull Secret` named `rhdh-pull-secret` using your Red Hat credentials to access images from the protected `registry.redhat.io`.
. Create an Ingress manifest file, named `rhdh-ingress.yaml`, specifying your {product-short} service name.
. Deploy the created Ingress.
. Create a ConfigMap named `app-config-rhdh` containing the {product-short} configuration.
. Create a Secret named `secrets-rhdh` and add a key named `BACKEND_SECRET` with a `Base64-encoded` string value.
. Create a Custom Resource (CR) manifest file named `rhdh.yaml` and include the previously created `rhdh-pull-secret`.
. Apply the Custom Resource (CR) manifest to your namespace.
. Access the deployed {product-short} using the URL: `https://<app_address>`, where <app_address> is the Ingress address obtained earlier.
