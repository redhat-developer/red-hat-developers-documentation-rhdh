= Registering components manually in your {product-very-short} instance

To manually register components in your {product-very-short} instance, create a `catalog-info.yaml` file and register it with your {product} instance. The `catalog-info.yaml` file contains the metadata you wish to register for your software component.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed and configured the {product} instance.
* You have the required permissions. See link:{authorization-book-url}[{authorization-book-title}].

.Procedure

. In the root directory of your software project, create a file named `catalog-info.yaml`.

----
. Commit the `catalog-info.yaml` file to the root of your project source code repository.
. In your {product} navigation menu, go to *Catalog* > *Self-service*.
. On the *Self-service* page, click *Register Existing Component*.
. On the *Register an existing component* page, enter the full URL of the `catalog-info.yaml` file in your repository. For example: link:https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/examples/components/artist-lookup-component.yaml[Artist lookup component].
. Complete the wizard instructions.
