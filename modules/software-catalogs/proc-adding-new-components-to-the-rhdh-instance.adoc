= Adding new components to your {product} instance

.Prerequisites

* You have installed and configured the {product} instance.
* You have the required permissions. See link:{authorization-book-url}[{authorization-book-title}].

.Procedure

You can add components to your {product-very-short} instance using the following methods:

* Register components manually using the GUI or by using your `{my-app-config-file}` with the required permissions.
* Create new components by using Software Templates.
* Use the bulk import plugin with the required permissions. For more information, see link:{configuring-dynamic-plugins-book-url}#bulk-importing-github-repositories[the bulk import plugin].

== Registering components manually in your {product-very-short} instance

To manually register components in your {product-very-short} instance, create a `catalog-info.yaml` file and register it with your {product} instance. The `catalog-info.yaml` file contains the metadata you wish to register for your software component.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed and configured the {product} instance.
* You have the required permissions. See link:{authorization-book-url}[{authorization-book-title}].

.Procedure

To add a new component to your {product-very-short} instance, complete the following steps:

. In the root directory of your software project, create a file named `catalog-info.yaml`.

.Example of a `catalog-info.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
    name: _<your_software_component>_
    description: _<software_component_brief_description>_
    tags:
         - example
         - service
    annotations:
         github.com/project-slug: _<repo_link_of_your_component_to_register>_
spec:
    type: _<your_service>_

    lifecycle: _<your_lifecycle>_
----
. Commit the `catalog-info.yaml` file to the root of your project source code repository.
. In your {product} navigation menu, go to *Catalog* > *Self-service*.
. On the *Self-service* page, click *Register Existing Component*.
. On the *Register an existing component* page, enter the full URL of the `catalog-info.yaml` file in your repository. For example: link:https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/examples/components/artist-lookup-component.yaml[Artist lookup component].
. Complete the wizard instructions.

.Verification

* Your software component is listed in the Software Catalog. You can view its details and ensure all the metadata is accurate.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed and configured the {product} instance.
* You have the required permissions. See link:{authorization-book-url}[{authorization-book-title}].
