= Installing {product} in a partially disconnected environment with the Operator

On an {ocp-short} cluster operating on a restricted network, public resources are not available. However, deploying the {product} Operator and running {product-short} requires the following public resources:

* Operator images (bundle, operator, catalog)
* Operands images ({product-very-short}, PostgreSQL)

To make these resources available, replace them with their equivalent resources in a mirror registry accessible to your cluster.

You can use a helper script that mirrors the necessary images and provides the necessary configuration to ensure those images are used when installing the {product} Operator and creating {product-short} instances. This script requires a target mirror registry. You likely have a target mirror registry if your cluster is already operating on a disconnected network. If you do not already have a target registry, and if you have an {ocp-short} cluster, you might want to expose and leverage the internal cluster registry.

When connected to a {ocp-short} cluster, the helper script detects it and automatically exposes the cluster registry. If connected to a Kubernetes cluster, you can manually specify the target registry to mirror the images.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed Podman 5.3 or later. For more information, see link:https://podman.io/docs/installation[Podman Installation Instructions].
* You have installed Skopeo 1.17 or later.
* You have installed `yq` 4.44 or later.
* You have installed the GNU `sed` command line text editor.
* You have installed `umoci` CLI tool.
* You have an active `oc registry`, `podman`, or `skopeo` session to the `registry.redhat.io` {company-name} Ecosystem Catalog. For more information, see link:link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/RegistryAuthentication[{company-name} Container Registry Authentication].
* You have an active `skopeo` session with administrative access to the target mirror registry. For more information, see link:https://github.com/containers/skopeo#authenticating-to-a-registry[Authenticating to a registry].
* You have installed the `opm` CLI tool. For more information, see {ocp-docs-link}/html/cli_tools/opm-cli#olm-about-opm_cli-opm-install[Installing the opm CLI].
* If you are using an {ocp-short} cluster, you have the following prerequisites:
** (Optional) You have installed the `oc-mirror` {ocp-short} CLI plugin if you want to use it to mirror images.
* If you are using a supported Kubernetes cluster, you have the following prerequisites:
** You have installed the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on the disconnected cluster.
** You have a mirror registry that is reachable from the disconnected cluster.
* Make sure that your system meets the minimum sizing requirements. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.7/html-single/about_red_hat_developer_hub/index#rhdh-sizing_about-rhdh[Sizing requirements for {product}].

.Procedure
. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to save the mirroring script.
. Download the mirroring script by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/refs/heads/release-{product-version}/.rhdh/scripts/prepare-restricted-environment.sh
----
+
. Run the mirroring script by using the `bash` command with the appropriate set of options:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
bash prepare-restricted-environment.sh \
 --filter-versions "{product-version}" \
  [--to-registry _<my.registry.example.com>_] \ <1>
  [--use-oc-mirror true] <2>
----
<1> Specifies the URL for the target mirror registry where you want to mirror the images.
<2> (Optional) Uses the `oc-mirror` {ocp-short} CLI plugin to mirror images.
+
[NOTE]
====
The script can take several minutes to complete as it copies multiple images to the mirror registry.
====

.Verification
* If you are using {ocp-brand-name}, the {product} Operator is in the *Installed Operators* list in the web console.
* If you are using a supported Kubernetes platform, you can check the list of pods running in the `rhdh-operator` namespace by running the following command in your terminal:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
kubectl -n rhdh-operator get pods
----

.Next steps
* Use the Operator to create a {product} instance on a supported platform. For more information, see the following documentation for the platform that you want to use:
