= Deploying {product} on {ocp-short} using Helm Chart

You can use a Helm chart in {ocp-brand-name} to install {product-short},  which is a flexible installation method.

Helm is a package manager on {ocp-short} that provides the following features:

* Applies regular application updates using custom hooks
* Manages the installation of complex applications
* Provides charts that you can host on public and private servers
* Supports rolling back to previous application versions

The {product} Helm chart is available in the Helm catalog on {osd-short} and {ocp-short}.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to your {ocp-short} account.
* A user with the {ocp-short} `admin` role has configured the appropriate roles and permissions within your project to create an application. For more information about {ocp-short} roles, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/authentication/using-rbac.html[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* You have created a project in {ocp-short}. For more information about creating a project in {ocp-short}, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/applications/projects/working-with-projects.html#odc-creating-projects-using-developer-perspective_projects[{ocp-brand-name} documentation]. 

.Procedure
 
. From the *Developer* perspective on the {product-short} web console, click *+Add*.
. From the *Developer Catalog* panel, click *Helm Chart*.
. In the *Filter by keyword* box, enter _Developer Hub_ and click the *{product}* card.
. From the {product} page, click *Create*.
. From your cluster, copy the {ocp-short} router host (for example: `apps.<clusterName>.com`).
. Select the radio button to configure the {product-short} instance with either the form view or YAML view. The Form view is selected by default. 

** Using *Form view* 
+
.. To configure the instance with the Form view, go to *Root Schema* -> *global* -> *Enable service authentication within Backstage instance* and paste your {ocp-short} router host into the field on the form. 

** Using *YAML view* 
+
.. To configure the instance with the YAML view, paste your {ocp-short} router hostname in the `global.clusterRouterBase` parameter value as shown in the following example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
global:
  auth:
    backend:
      enabled: true
  clusterRouterBase: apps.<clusterName>.com
  # other Red Hat Developer Hub Helm Chart configurations
----
+ 
. Edit the other values if needed.
+
[NOTE]
====
The information about the host is copied and can be accessed by the {product-short} backend. 

When an {ocp-short} route is generated automatically, the host value for the route is inferred and the same host information is sent to the {product-short}. Also, if the {product-short} is present on a custom domain by setting the host manually using values, the custom host takes precedence.
====
+
. Click *Create* and wait for the database and {product-short} to start.
. Click the *Open URL* icon to start using the {product-short} platform.
