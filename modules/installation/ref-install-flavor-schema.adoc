= Flavor manifest schema

The flavor manifest is a `kustomization.yaml` file that serves as the central definition for a flavor.
This file is used by the {product-very-short} Operator to orchestrate the deployment of all other components.
The manifest schema leverages standard Kustomize fields and is typically structured as follows:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - config/
  - resources/
  - hooks/
----

_apiVersion_ and _kind_:: These are standard Kustomize fields that define the schema version and type.

_resources_:: This field is a list that points to the directories containing the flavor's configuration files, Kubernetes resources, and hooks.
The Operator uses this list to process and apply all the components within the flavor.

== Configuration options

A flavor's configuration is managed through the directories and files referenced in its manifest.
The primary configuration options are:

{product-very-short} application configuration:: The _config/app-config.yaml_ file contains the core configuration for the {product-very-short} instance.
This can include settings for the backend, authentication providers, and other core functionalities.

Dynamic plugins configuration:: Files located in the _config/plugins/_ directory define the settings for specific dynamic plugins.
This includes enabling or disabling plugins and configuring their unique properties.

Kubernetes resources:: The _resources/_ directory contains standard Kubernetes manifests.
This can include:
+
* Dependency manifests that define Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for external services.

* Catalog entities which are YAML files for initial catalog entries, such as templates, components, and APIs.

Hooks:: The _hooks/_ directory contains manifests for Kubernetes jobs.
These jobs can be used to perform pre-installation or post-installation tasks, such as creating secrets or running data migrations.

Platform-Specific Overrides:: Flavors can include platform-specific patches.
Files with a _.k8s_ or _.ocp_ extension for example, _app-config.yaml.ocp_ provide overrides for vanilla Kubernetes and OpenShift environments, respectively.
The operator automatically applies the correct patch based on the cluster's platform.
