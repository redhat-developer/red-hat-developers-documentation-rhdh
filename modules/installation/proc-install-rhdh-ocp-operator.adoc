= Deploying {product} on {ocp-short} with the Operator

As a developer, you can deploy a {product} instance on {ocp-short} by using the *Developer Catalog* in the {ocp-brand-name} web console. This deployment method uses the {product} Operator.

.Prerequisites
* You have set the `baseUrl` in your `{my-app-config-file}` to match the external URL of your {product-short} instance. Without it, frontend and backend services cannot communicate, and features might not work as expected.
* xref:proc-install-operator_{context}[An {ocp-short} administrator has installed the {product} Operator].
* {configuring-book-link}#provisioning-your-custom-configuration[You have provisioned your custom config maps and secrets in your `_<{my-product-namespace}>_` project].
* {configuring-book-link}#using-the-operator-to-run-rhdh-with-your-custom-configuration[You have authored your {product-custom-resource-type} custom resource].

.Procedure

. In the {ocp-short} web console, select your `_<{my_product_namespace}>_` project, then click *Add*.
. From the *Developer Catalog* panel, click *Operator Backed*.
. In the *Filter by keyword* box, enter _{product-short}_ and click the *{product}* card.
. Provision your custom configuration using the following template:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config-rhdh
data:
  "app-config-rhdh.yaml": |
    app:
      title: {product}
      baseUrl: {my-product-url}
    backend:
      auth:
        externalAccess:
            - type: legacy
              options:
                subject: legacy-default-config
                secret: "${BACKEND_SECRET}"
      baseUrl: {my-product-url}
      cors:
        origin: {my-product-url}
----
+
Use a config map named `app-config-rhdh` to provide your `app-config.yaml` file, and a Secret for service-to-service authentication (such as `BACKEND_SECRET`).
+
To create and apply these configuration resources, follow the steps in {configuring-book-link}#provisioning-and-using-your-custom-configuration[Provisioning your custom {product} configuration] for the full procedure.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `app-config-rhdh` config map must include your customized `app-config.yaml` file. This config map is mounted into the {product-short} container at runtime.
====

. Create a secret named `{my-product-secrets}` and add a key named `BACKEND_SECRET` with a `Base64-encoded` string as value, as shown in the following example:
+
--
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: {my-product-secrets}
stringData:
  # TODO: Add the necessary auth secrets for service-to-service auth setup
  BACKEND_SECRET: "xxx" # Replace with your `Base64-encoded` secret
----
--
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that your secret includes `BACKEND_SECRET`, used for service-to-service authentication. For structure and provisioning steps, see {configuring-book-link}#provisioning-and-using-your-custom-configuration[Provisioning your custom {product} configuration].
====
. Click *Create*.
. {configuring-book-link}#using-the-operator-to-run-rhdh-with-your-custom-configuration[Add your {product-custom-resource-type} custom resource content].
. On the *Create Backstage* page, click *Create*.

.Verification

After the pods are ready, you can access the {product} platform by opening the URL.

. Confirm that the pods are ready by clicking the pod in the *Topology* view and confirming the *Status* in the *Details* panel. The pod status is *Active* when the pod is ready.

. From the *Topology* view, click the *Open URL* icon on the {product-short} pod.
