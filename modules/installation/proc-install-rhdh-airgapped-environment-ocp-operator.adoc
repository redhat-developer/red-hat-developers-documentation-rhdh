[id="proc-install-rhdh-airgapped-environment-ocp-operator_{context}"]
= Installing {product} in an air-gapped environment with the Operator

On an {ocp-short} cluster operating on a restricted network, public resources are not available. However, deploying the {product} Operator and running {product-short} requires the following public resources:

* Operator images (bundle, operator, catalog)
* Operands images ({product-very-short}, PostgreSQL)

To make these resources available, replace them with their equivalent resources in a mirror registry accessible to the {ocp-short} cluster.

You can use a helper script that mirrors the necessary images and provides the necessary configuration to ensure those images will be used when installing the {product} Operator and creating {product-short} instances.

[NOTE]
====
This script requires a target mirror registry which you should already have installed if your {ocp-short} cluster is ready to operate on a restricted network. However, if you are preparing your cluster for disconnected usage, you can use the script to deploy a mirror registry in the cluster and use it for the mirroring process.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have an active {openshift-cli} session with administrative permissions to the {ocp-short} cluster. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html-single/cli_tools/index#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI].
* You have an active `oc registry` session to the `registry.redhat.io` {company-name} Ecosystem Catalog. See link:https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[{company-name} Container Registry Authentication].
* The `opm` CLI tool is installed. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html-single/cli_tools/index#olm-about-opm_cli-opm-install[Installing the opm CLI].
* The jq package is installed. See link:https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/[Download jq].
* Podman is installed. See link:https://podman.io/docs/installation[Podman Installation Instructions].
* Skopeo version 1.14 or higher is installed. link:https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/main/install.md[See Installing Skopeo].
* If you already have a mirror registry for your cluster, an active Skopeo session with administrative access to this registry is required. See link:https://github.com/containers/skopeo#authenticating-to-a-registry[Authenticating to a registry] and link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html-single/disconnected_installation_mirroring/index#prerequisites_installing-mirroring-installation-images[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation].

[NOTE]
====
The internal {ocp-short} cluster image registry cannot be used as a target mirror registry. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html-single/disconnected_installation_mirroring/index#installation-about-mirror-registry_installing-mirroring-installation-images[About the mirror registry].
====

* If you prefer to create your own mirror registry, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html-single/disconnected_installation_mirroring/index#installing-mirroring-creating-registry[Creating a mirror registry with mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift].

* If you do not already have a mirror registry, you can use the helper script to create one for you and you need the following additional prerequisites:
+
** The cURL package is installed. For {rhel}, the curl command is available by installing the curl package. To use curl for other platforms, see the link:https://curl.se/[cURL website].
** The `htpasswd` command is available. For {rhel}, the `htpasswd` command is available by installing the `httpd-tools` package.

.Procedure
. Download and run the mirroring script to install a custom Operator catalog and mirror the related images: `prepare-restricted-environment.sh` (link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/blob/release-{product-version}/.rhdh/scripts/prepare-restricted-environment.sh[source]).

curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/{product-version}.x/.rhdh/scripts/prepare-restricted-environment.sh

# if you do not already have a target mirror registry
# and want the script to create one for you
# use the following example:
bash prepare-restricted-environment.sh \
   --prod_operator_index "registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v{ocp-version}" \
   --prod_operator_package_name "rhdh" \
   --prod_operator_bundle_name "rhdh-operator" \
   --prod_operator_version "v{product-bundle-version}"

# if you already have a target mirror registry
# use the following example:
bash prepare-restricted-environment.sh \
   --prod_operator_index "registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v{ocp-version}" \
   --prod_operator_package_name "rhdh" \
   --prod_operator_bundle_name "rhdh-operator" \
   --prod_operator_version "v{product-bundle-version}" \
   --use_existing_mirror_registry "my_registry"

[NOTE]
====
The script can take several minutes to complete as it copies multiple images to the mirror registry.
