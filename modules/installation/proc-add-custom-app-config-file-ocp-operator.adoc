[id="proc-add-custom-app-config-file-ocp-operator_{context}"]
= Adding a custom application configuration file to {ocp-short} using the Operator

A custom application configuration file is a `ConfigMap` object that you can use to change the configuration of your {product} instance. If you are deploying your {product-short} instance on {ocp-brand-name}, you can use the {product} Operator to add a custom application configuration file to your {ocp-short} instance by creating the `ConfigMap` object and referencing it in the {product-short} custom resource (CR).

The custom application configuration file contains a sensitive environment variable, named `BACKEND_SECRET`. This variable contains a mandatory backend authentication key that {product-short} uses to reference an environment variable defined in an {ocp-short} secret. You must create a secret, named 'secrets-rhdh', and reference it in the {product-short} CR.

[NOTE]
====
You are responsible for protecting your {product} installation from external and unauthorized access. Manage the backend authentication key like any other secret. Meet strong password requirements, do not expose it in any configuration files, and only inject it into configuration files as an environment variable.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have an active {ocp-brand-name} account.
* Your administrator has installed the {product} Operator in {ocp-short}. For more information, see link:{LinkAdminGuide}[Installing the {product} Operator].
* You have created the {product} CR in {ocp-short}.

.Procedure
. From the *Developer* perspective in the {ocp-short} web console, select the *Topology* view, and click the *Open URL* icon on the {product-short} pod to identify your {product-short} external URL: __<{product-very-short}_URL>__.
. From the *Developer* perspective in the {ocp-short} web console, select the *ConfigMaps* view.
. Click *Create ConfigMap*.
. Select the *YAML view* option in *Configure via* and use the following example as a base template to create a `ConfigMap` object, such as `app-config-rhdh.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: app-config-rhdh
data:
  "app-config-rhdh.yaml": |
    app:
      title: {product}
      baseUrl: <{product-very-short}_URL> # <1>
    backend:
      auth:
        keys:
          - secret: "${BACKEND_SECRET}" # <2>
      baseUrl: <{product-very-short}_URL> # <1>
      cors:
        origin: <{product-very-short}_URL> # <1>
----
+
<1> Set the external URL of your {product} instance.
<2> Use an environment variable exposing an {ocp-short} secret to define the mandatory backend authentication key for {product}.

. Click *Create*.
. Select the *Secrets* view.
. Click *Create Key/value Secret*.
. Create a secret named `secrets-rhdh`.
. Add a key named `BACKEND_SECRET` and a base64 encoded string as a value. Use a unique value for each {product} instance. For example, you can use the following command to generate a key from your terminal:
+
[source,yaml]
----
node -p 'require("crypto").randomBytes(24).toString("base64")'
----

. Click *Create*.
. Select the *Topology* view.
. Click the overflow menu for the {product} instance that you want to use and select *Edit Backstage* to load the YAML view of the {product} instance.

. In the CR, enter the name of the custom application configuration config map as the value for the `spec.application.appConfig.configMaps` field, and enter the name of your secret as the value for the `spec.application.extraEnvs.secrets` field. For example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  application:
    appConfig:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
      configMaps:
         - name: app-config-rhdh
    extraEnvs:
      secrets:
         - name: secrets-rhdh
    extraFiles:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
    replicas: 1
    route:
      enabled: true
  database:
    enableLocalDb: true
----
. Click *Save*.
. Navigate back to the *Topology* view and wait for the {product} pod to start.
. Click the *Open URL* icon to use the {product} platform with the configuration changes.
