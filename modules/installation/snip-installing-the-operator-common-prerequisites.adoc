= Installing the {product-short} Operator on {platform-long} by using the OLM framework

The {company-name} Ecosystem, based on the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) framework,
contains a distribution of the {product} Operator, aimed at managing your {product} instance lifecycle.

However, on {platform-long}:

* The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) framework and the {company-name} Ecosystem are not built-in.
* The {company-name} Ecosystem pull-secret is not managed globally.

Therefore, install the OLM framework, the {company-name} Ecosystem,
and provision your {company-name} Ecosystem pull secret to install {product-short} Operator.
