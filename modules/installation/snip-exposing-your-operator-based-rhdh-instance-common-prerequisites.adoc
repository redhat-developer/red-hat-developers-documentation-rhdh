= Exposing your operator-based {product} instance on {platform-long}

On {platform-long}, to expose your {product} instance, {platform-generic} ingresses replace {ocp-short} routes.
The {product} operator does not create ingresses.
Therefore, to access your {product-short} instance via a domain name,
create the required ingresses on {platform} and point your domain name to it.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed {product} by using the {product} Operator.
