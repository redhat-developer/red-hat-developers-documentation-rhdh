= Creating a custom flavor
A custom flavor is a new operator profile with a specific directory structure. You can create a new flavor by following these steps:

.Procedure

. Create a dedicated directory for your flavor, following a standardized structure. This structure helps the operator identify and process all the components of your flavor:

_kustomize.yaml_:: This is your flavor's manifest file that acts as the central definition, orchestrating the application of all other files in the directory.

_config/_:: Contains the core app-config.yaml for {product}, along with any plugin-specific configuration files.

_resources/_:: Holds additional Kubernetes resources your flavor needs. This can include CRDs for dependencies or initial catalog entities to populate {product-very-short}.

_hooks/_:: Contains manifests for Kubernetes jobs that run before (pre-install) or after (post-install) the {product-very-short} instance is deployed.

. (Optional) If your flavor uses dynamic plugins that require specific Kubernetes resources, define these resources as YAML manifests in your `config/profile/{PROFILE}/plugin-deps` directory.

. (Optional) For dependencies that require operators or other infrastructure, specify them in the _plugin-infra_ directory.

. (Optional) Write Kubernetes job manifests for any pre-installation or post-installation tasks. The Operator will execute these jobs and monitor their status.
