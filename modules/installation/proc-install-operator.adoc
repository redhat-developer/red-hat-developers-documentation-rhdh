= Installing the {product} Operator

As an administrator, you can install the {product} Operator. Authorized users can use the Operator to install {product} on {ocp-brand-name} ({ocp-short}) and supported Kubernetes platforms. For more information on supported platforms and versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/developerhub[{product} Life Cycle] page.

Containers are available for the following CPU architectures:

* AMD64 and Intel 64 (`x86_64`)

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in as an administrator on the {ocp-short} web console.
* You have configured the appropriate roles and permissions within your project to create or access an application. For more information, see the {ocp-docs-link}/html-single/building_applications/index#building-applications-overview[{ocp-brand-name} documentation on Building applications].
* You have installed {ocp-brand-name} {ocp-version-min} to {ocp-version}.
* Make sure that your system meets the minimum sizing requirements. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.7/html-single/about_red_hat_developer_hub/index#rhdh-sizing_about-rhdh[Sizing requirements for {product}].

.Procedure

. In the navigation menu of the {ocp-short} console, click *Operators > OperatorHub*.
. In the *Filter by keyword* box, enter {product-short} and click the *{product} Operator* card.
. On the *{product} Operator* page, read the information about the Operator and click *Install* to open the *Install Operator* page.
.  After the Operator is successfully installed, provision your custom configuration:
+
Before you create a {product-short} instance, you must create the required config map and Secret resources in your project. These include the `baseUrl` and service-to-service authentication secrets.
+
For detailed steps, see {configuring-book-link}#provisioning-and-using-your-custom-configuration[Provisioning your custom {product} configuration].
. From the *Update channel* drop-down menu, select the update channel that you want to use, for example, *fast* or *fast-{product-version}*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `*fast* channel includes all of the updates available for a particular version. Any update might introduce unexpected changes in your {product} deployment. Check the release notes for details about any potentially breaking changes.

The *fast-{product-version}* channel only provides z-stream updates, for example, updating from version {product-version}.1 to {product-version}.2. If you want to update the {product} y-version in the future, for example, updating from {product-version} to {product-version-next}, you must switch to the *fast-{product-version-next}* channel manually.
====
. From the *Version* drop-down menu, select the version of the {product} Operator that you want to install. The default version is the latest version available in the selected channel.
. Select the Operator *Installation mode*.
//** If you select the *All namespaces on the cluster* option, the Operator is installed in all namespaces. This option is useful for Operators that manage cluster-wide resources.
//** If you select the *Specific namespace on the cluster* option, the Operator is installed in a specific namespace. This option is useful for Operators that manage resources in a specific namespace.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* option is selected by default. The *Specific namespace on the cluster* option is not currently supported.
====
. In the *Installed Namespace* field, do one of the following actions:
+
** Select *Operator recommended Namespace* to create and use the *rhdh-operator* namespace. This option is selected by default.
** Select *Select a Namespace* to use an alternative namespace.
*** From the *Select Project* drop-down menu, do one of the following actions:
**** Select an existing project.
**** Select *Create Project* to create a new project for the Operator.
***** On the *Create Project* dialog, enter text into the required fields and click *Create*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For enhanced security, better control over the Operator lifecycle, and preventing potential privilege escalation, install the {product} Operator in a dedicated default `rhdh-operator` namespace. You can restrict other users' access to the Operator resources through role bindings or cluster role bindings.

You can also install the Operator in another namespace by creating the necessary resources, such as an Operator group. For more information, see {ocp-docs-link}/html-single/operators/index#olm-installing-global-namespaces_olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Installing global Operators in custom namespaces].

However, if the {product} Operator shares a namespace with other Operators, then it shares the same update policy as well, preventing the customization of the update policy. For example, if one Operator is set to manual updates, the {product} Operator update policy is also set to manual. For more information, see {ocp-docs-link}/html-single/operators/index#olm-colocation-namespaces_olm-colocation[Colocation of Operators in a namespace].
====
+
. Select the *Update approval* method for the Operator.
** If you select the *Automatic* option, the Operator is updated without requiring manual confirmation.
** If you select the *Manual* option, a notification opens when a new update is released in the update channel. The update must be manually approved by an administrator before installation can begin.
. Click *Install*.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you selected a *Manual* approval strategy, the upgrade status of the subscription remains *Upgrading* until you review and approve the install plan. After you click *Approve* on the *Install Plan* page, the subscription upgrade status changes to *Up to date*.

If you selected an *Automatic* approval strategy, the upgrade status should resolve to *Up to date* without intervention.
====

.Verification

* Immediately after the Operator is installed, the dialog box on the *OperatorHub* page displays the *Installed operator: ready for use* message.
* From the dialog box, do one of the following actions:
 ** Click *View Operator* to open the *Operator details* page for the {product} Operator.
 ** Click *View all installed operators* to open the *Installed Operators* page.
 *** From the list of installed Operators, locate the {product} Operator name and details.
 *** Click *{product} Operator* to open the *Operator details* page for the {product} Operator.
