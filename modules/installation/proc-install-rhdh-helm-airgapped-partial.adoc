= Installing {product} on {ocp-short} in a partially disconnected environment with the Helm chart

If your network has access to the `registry.redhat.io` registry and the `charts.openshift.io` Helm chart repository, you can deploy your {product} instance in your partially disconnected environment by mirroring the specified resources directly to the target registry.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {ocp-brand-name} {ocp-version-min} or later.
* You have access to the `charts.openshift.io` Helm chart repository.
* You have access to the `registry.redhat.io`.
* You have access to a mirror registry that can be reached from the disconnected cluster, for example, the {ocp-short} image registry. For more information about exposing the {ocp-short} image registry, see {ocp-docs-link}/html-single/registry/index#securing-exposing-registry[Exposing the registry].
* You are logged in to your target mirror registry and have permissions to push images to it. For more information, see {ocp-docs-link}/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#installation-adding-registry-pull-secret_about-installing-oc-mirror-v2[Configuring credentials that allow images to be mirrored].
* You have installed the {openshift-cli} on your workstation.
* {ocp-docs-link}/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#about-installing-oc-mirror-v2[You have installed the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI plugin].
* You have an account in https://developers.redhat.com/[{rhdeveloper-name}] portal.
* Make sure that your system meets the minimum sizing requirements. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.7/html-single/about_red_hat_developer_hub/index#rhdh-sizing_about-rhdh[Sizing requirements for {product}].

.Procedure
. Log in to your {ocp-short} account using the {openshift-cli} by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc login -u <user> -p <password> https://api.<hostname>:6443
----

. From your disconnected cluster, log in to the image registry that you want to mirror, for example, the {ocp-short} image registry.
. Create an `ImageSetConfiguration.yaml` file.
. In your `ImageSetConfiguration.yaml` file, specify the resources that you want to mirror. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:
  helm:
    repositories:
      - name: _<repository_name>_ (1)
        url: _<repository_url>_ (2)
        charts:
          - name: _<chart_name>_ (3)
            version: "_<rhdh_version>_" (4)
----
<1> The name of the repository containing the Helm chart that you want to mirror, for example, `openshift-charts`.
<2> The URL for the repository containing the Helm chart that you want to mirror, for example, `https://charts.openshift.io`.
<3> The name of the Helm chart containing the images that you want to mirror, for example, `redhat-developer-hub`.
<4> The {product} version that you want to use, for example, `{product-version}`

. Mirror the resources specified in the image set configuration file directly to the target registry by running the `oc-mirror` command. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
oc-mirror --config=_<mirror_config_directory>_/ImageSetConfiguration.yaml _<target-mirror-registry>_
----
+
--
where:

`<mirror_config_directory>` :: Specifies the location of your image set configuration file on your system, for example, `.user`.

`<target_mirror_registry>` :: Specifies the location and name of your target mirror registry, for example,`docker://registry.example:5000`.
--
+
[NOTE]
====
Running the `oc-mirror` command creates a local workspace containing the Helm chart and a `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) manifest. The ICSP manifest contains an automatically-generated `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file that you must apply against the cluster in a later step.

+
.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
Writing image mapping to oc-mirror-workspace/results-1738070846/mapping.txt
Writing ICSP manifests to oc-mirror-workspace/results-1738070846
----
+
. In your workspace, locate the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file by running the `ls` command. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
ls _<workspace_directory>_/_<results_directory>_
----
+
--
where:

`<workspace_directory>` :: Specifies the name of your workspace directory, for example, `oc-mirror-workspace`.

`<results_directory>` :: Specifies the name of your results directory, for example, `results-1738070846`.
--
+
. To mirror the Helm chart, deploy the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file in the disconnected cluster by running the `oc apply` command. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
oc apply -f _<workspace_directory>_/_<results_directory>_/`ImageContentSourcePolicy.yaml`
----
+
--
where:

`<workspace_directory>` :: Specifies the name of your workspace directory, for example, `oc-mirror-workspace`.

`<results_directory>` :: Specifies the name of your results directory, for example, `results-1738070846`.
--
. In your air-gapped environment, deploy the Helm chart to the namespace that you want to use by running the `helm install` command with `namespace` and `set` options. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
CLUSTER_ROUTER_BASE=$(oc get route console -n openshift-console -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}' | sed 's/^[^.]*\.//')

helm install _<rhdh_instance>_ _<workspace_directory>_/_<results_directory>_/charts/_<archive_file>_ --namespace _<your_namespace>_ --create-namespace \
  --set global.clusterRouterBase="$CLUSTER_ROUTER_BASE"
----
+
--
where:

`<rhdh_instance>` :: Specifies the name of your {product} instance, for example, `my-rhdh`.

`<workspace_directory>` :: Specifies the name of your workspace directory, for example, `oc-mirror-workspace`.

`<results_directory>` :: Specifies the name of your results directory, for example, `results-1738070846`.

`<archive_file>` :: Specifies the name of the archive file containing the resources that you want to mirror, for example, `redhat-developer-hub-1.4.1.tgz`.

`<your_namespace>` :: Specifies the namespace that you want to deploy the Helm chart to, for example, `{my-product-namespace}`.
