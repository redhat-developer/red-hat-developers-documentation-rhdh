= Installing {product-short} on {gke-short} with the Helm chart

When you install the {product-short} Helm chart in {gke-brand-name} ({gke-short}), it orchestrates the deployment of a {product-short} instance, which provides a robust developer platform within the {gke-short} ecosystem.

.Prerequisites
* You have subscribed to `registry.redhat.io`. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[{company-name} Container Registry Authentication].
* You have installed `kubectl`. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[Install kubetl].
* You have installed the Google Cloud CLI. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[Install the gcloud CLI].
* You have logged in to your Google account and created a https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-an-autopilot-cluster[GKE Autopilot] or https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-zonal-cluster[GKE Standard] cluster.
* You have installed Helm 3 or the latest version. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/helm.html[Using Helm with Amazon {eks-short}].

* You have configured a domain name for your {product-short} instance.
* You have reserved a static external Premium IPv4 Global IP address that is not attached to any VM. For more information see https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/reserve-static-external-ip-address#reserve_new_static[Reserve a new static external IP address]
* You have configured the DNS records for your domain name to point to the IP address that has been reserved. 
+
[NOTE]
====
You need to create an `A` record with the value equal to the IP address. This can take up to one hour to propagate.
====
* You have installed Helm 3 or the latest. For more information, see https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install[Installing Helm].

.Procedure
. Go to your terminal and run the following command to add the Helm chart repository containing the {product-short} chart to your local Helm registry:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
helm repo add openshift-helm-charts https://charts.openshift.io/
----
--

. Create a pull secret using the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
kubectl -n <your-namespace> create secret docker-registry rhdh-pull-secret \ <1>
    --docker-server=registry.redhat.io \
    --docker-username=<user_name> \ <2>
    --docker-password=<password> \ <3>
    --docker-email=<email> <4>
----
<1> Enter your {gke-short} namespace in the command.
<2> Enter your username in the command.
<3> Enter your password in the command.
<4> Enter your email address in the command.

The created pull secret is used to pull the {product-short} images from the {company-name} Ecosystem.
--

. Set up a Google-managed certificate by creating a `ManagedCertificate` object that you will attach to the Ingress.
+
--
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1
kind: ManagedCertificate
metadata:
  name: <rhdh_certificate_name>
spec:
  domains:
    - <rhdh_domain_name>
----
--
For more information about setting up a Google-managed certificate, see https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/managed-certs?hl=en#setting_up_a_google-managed_certificate[Setting up a Google-managed certificate].

. Create a `FrontendConfig` object to set a policy for redirecting to HTTPS. You must attach this policy to the ingress. 
+
--
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1beta1
kind: FrontendConfig
metadata:
  name: <ingress_security_config>
spec:
  sslPolicy: gke-ingress-ssl-policy-https
  redirectToHttps:
    enabled: true
----
--
For more information about setting a policy to redirect to HTTPS, see https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ingress-configuration?hl=en#https_redirect[HTTP to HTTPS redirects].

. Create a file named `values.yaml` using the following template:
+
.Example `values.yaml` file
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
global:
  host: <rhdh_domain_name>
route:
  enabled: false
upstream:
  service:
    type: NodePort
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: gce
      kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: <ADDRESS_NAME>
      networking.gke.io/managed-certificates: <rhdh_certificate_name>
      networking.gke.io/v1beta1.FrontendConfig: <ingress_security_config>
    className: gce
  backstage:
    image:
      pullSecrets:
      - rhdh-pull-secret
    podSecurityContext:
      fsGroup: 2000
  postgresql:
    image:
      pullSecrets:
      - rhdh-pull-secret
    primary:
      podSecurityContext:
        enabled: true
        fsGroup: 3000
  volumePermissions:
    enabled: true
----
. Run the following command in your terminal to deploy {product-short} using the latest version of Helm Chart and using the `values.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
helm -n <your_namespace> install -f values.yaml <your_deploy_name> \
  openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub \
  --version {product-chart-version}
----
+
For the latest Helm Chart version, see https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/charts/tree/main/charts/redhat/redhat/redhat-developer-hub
+
. Confirm that the deployment is complete.
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get deploy <you_deploy_name>-developer-hub -n <your_namespace>
----

. Verify that the service and ingress were created.
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get service -n <your_namespace>
kubectl get ingress -n <your_namespace>
----
+
[NOTE]
Wait for the `ManagedCertificate` to be provisioned. This can take a couple of hours.

. Access {product-very-short} with `https://<rhdh_domain_name>`

. To upgrade your deployment, use the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
helm -n <your_namespace> upgrade -f values.yaml <your_deploy_name> openshift-helm-charts/redhat-developer-hub --version <UPGRADE_CHART_VERSION>

----

. To delete your deployment, use the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
helm -n <your_namespace> delete <your_deploy_name>
----

.Verification

Wait until the DNS name is responsive, indicating that your {product-short} instance is ready for use.
