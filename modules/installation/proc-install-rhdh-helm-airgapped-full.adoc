= Installing {product} on {ocp-short} in a fully disconnected environment with the Helm chart

If your network has access to the registry through a bastion host, you can use the Helm chart to install {product} by mirroring specified resources to disk and transferring them to your air-gapped environment without any connection to the internet.

.Prerequisites

* You have set up your workstation.
** You have access to the registry.redhat.io.
** You have access to the charts.openshift.io Helm chart repository.
** You have installed the {openshift-cli} on your workstation.
* {ocp-docs-link}/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#about-installing-oc-mirror-v2[You have installed the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI plugin].
** You have an account in https://developers.redhat.com/[{rhdeveloper-name}] portal.
** You have set up your intermediary host.
** Your host has access to the disconnected cluster and to the target mirror registry, for example, the {ocp-brand-name} image registry. For more information about exposing the {ocp-short} image registry, see {ocp-docs-link}/html-single/registry/index#securing-exposing-registry[Exposing the registry].
** {ocp-docs-link}/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#about-installing-oc-mirror-v2[You have installed the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI plugin].
** You have installed {ocp-brand-name} {ocp-version-min} or later.
** You have installed the {openshift-cli} on your workstation.
* Make sure that your system meets the minimum sizing requirements. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.7/html-single/about_red_hat_developer_hub/index#rhdh-sizing_about-rhdh[Sizing requirements for {product}].

.Procedure
. Create an `ImageSetConfiguration` file to specify the resources that you want to mirror. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:
  helm:
    repositories:
           - name: _<repository_name>_ (1)
        url: _<repository_url>_ (2)
        charts:
          - name: _<chart_name>_ (3)
            version: "_<rhdh_version>_" (4)
----
<1> The name of the repository that you want to mirror, for example, `openshift-charts`.
<2> The URL for the repository that you want to mirror, for example, `https://charts.openshift.io`.
<3> The name of the Helm chart that you want to mirror, for example, `redhat-developer-hub`.
<4> The version of {product} that you want to use, for example, `{product-version}`

. Mirror the resources specified in the `ImageSetConfiguration.yaml` file by running the `oc-mirror` command. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
oc-mirror --config=_<mirror_config_directory>_/ImageSetConfiguration.yaml _<mirror_archive_directory>_/
----
+
--
where:

`<mirror_config_directory>` :: Specifies the location of your image set configuration file on your system, for example, `.user`.

`<mirror_configuration_file>` :: Specifies the name of your mirror configuration yaml file, for example, `mirror-config.yaml`

`<mirror_archive_directory>` :: Specifies the location of your directory where the mirror archive will be created, for example, `pass:[file://.user]`.
--
+
[NOTE]
====
Running the `oc-mirror` command generates a local workspace containing the mirror archive file, the Helm chart, and a `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) manifest. The ICSP manifest contains an `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file that you must apply against the cluster in a later step.
====
+
.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
Creating archive /path/to/mirror-archive/mirror_seq1_000000.tar
----
+
. Transfer the generated archive file (for example, `mirror_seq1_000000.tar`) to the air-gapped environment.
. Connect to your air-gapped environment and make sure that you are also connected to the following objects:
+
* The local target registry
* The target {ocp-short} cluster
+
. From your air-gapped environment, mirror the resources from the archive to the target registry by running the `oc-mirror` command. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
oc-mirror --from _<mirror-archive-file>_ _<target-registry>_
----
+
--
where:

`<mirror_archive_file>` :: Specifies the name of the file containing the resources that you want to mirror, for example,`mirror_seq1_0000.tar`.

`<target_registry>` :: Specifies the name of the target registry that you want to push the mirrored images to, for example, `docker://registry.localhost:5000`.
--
+
.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
Wrote release signatures to oc-mirror-workspace/results-1738075410
Writing image mapping to oc-mirror-workspace/results-1738075410/mapping.txt
Writing ICSP manifests to oc-mirror-workspace/results-1738075410
----
+
. In your workspace, locate the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file by running the `ls` command. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
ls _<workspace_directory>_/_<results_directory>_
----
+
--
where:

`<workspace_directory>` :: Specifies the name of your workspace directory, for example, `oc-mirror-workspace`.

`<results_directory>` :: Specifies the name of your results directory, for example, `results-1738070846`.
--
+
. To mirror the Helm chart, deploy the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file in the disconnected cluster by running the `oc apply` command. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
oc apply -f _<workspace_directory>_/_<results_directory>_/ImageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----
+
--
where:

`<workspace-directory>` :: Specifies the name of your workspace directory, for example, `oc-mirror-workspace`.

`<results-directory>` :: Specifies the name of your results directory, for example, `results-1738070846`.
--
. In your air-gapped environment, deploy the Helm chart to the namespace that you want to use by running the `helm install` command with `namespace` and `set` options. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
CLUSTER_ROUTER_BASE=$(oc get route console -n openshift-console -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}' | sed 's/^[^.]*\.//')

helm install _<rhdh_instance>_ _<workspace_directory>_/_<results_directory>_/charts/_<archive_file>_ --namespace _<your_namespace>_ --create-namespace \
  --set global.clusterRouterBase="$CLUSTER_ROUTER_BASE"
----
+
--
where:

`<rhdh_instance>` :: Specifies the name of your {product} instance, for example, `my-rhdh`.

`<workspace_directory>` :: Specifies the name of your workspace directory, for example, `oc-mirror-workspace`.

`<results_directory>` :: Specifies the name of your results directory, for example, `results-1738070846`.

`<archive_file>` :: Specifies the name of the archive file containing the resources that you want to mirror, for example, `redhat-developer-hub-1.4.1.tgz`.

`<your_namespace>` :: Specifies the namespace that you want to deploy the Helm chart to, for example, `{my-product-namespace}`.
