= Installing {product} using Helm Chart

You can use a Helm Chart in Red Hat OpenShift (OpenShift) to install {product}, which is a flexible installation method.

Helm is a package manager on OpenShift that provides the following features:

* Applies regular application updates using custom hooks
* Manages the installation of complex applications
* Provides charts that you can host on public and private servers
* Supports rolling back to previous application versions

The {product} Helm chart is available in the Helm catalog on Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated and OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the OCP using the OpenShift web console.
* You have configured the appropriate roles and permissions within your project to create an application.

.Procedure

. Switch to *Developer* mode on your Red Hat OpenShift web console.
. Click *+Add*.
. Click **create a Project**
. Choose a name for your project and click **Create**
. From the *Developer Catalog* panel, click *Helm Chart*.
. Search for _Developer Hub_ in the search bar and select the *{product}* card.
. Click *Create*.
. Note the OpenShift router host from *Root Schema* -> *global* -> *clusterRouterBase*, which will be needed in the next section, and adjust the other values if needed.

[NOTE]
====
If you did not configure a custom domain for your cluster, you will need to replace the *clusterRouterBase* with the base domain for your cluster, something like `apps.<clusterName>.com`.

. Click *Create* and wait for the database and {product} to start.
. Click the *Open URL* option to start using the {product} platform.

[NOTE]
====
In case your `developer-hub` pod is stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` and you see the following logs:

[source,log]
----
Loaded config from app-config-from-configmap.yaml, env
...
2023-07-24T19:44:46.223Z auth info Configuring "database" as KeyStore provider type=plugin
Backend failed to start up Error: Missing required config value at 'backend.database.client'
----

Then, verify the configuration files. This is because the configuration files are not being accessed by the RHDH container.
