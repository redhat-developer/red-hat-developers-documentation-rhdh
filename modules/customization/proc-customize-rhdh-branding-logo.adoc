= Customizing the branding logo of your {product-short} instance

You can customize the branding logo of your {product-short} instance by configuring the `branding` section the `app-config-rhdh.yaml` file, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
app:
  branding:
    fullLogo: ${BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO} <1>
    iconLogo: ${BASE64_EMBEDDED_ICON_LOGO} <2>
----

where:

<1> `fullLogo` is the logo on the expanded (pinned) sidebar and expects a base64 encoded image.
<2> `iconLogo` is the logo on the collapsed (unpinned) sidebar and expects a base64 encoded image.

You can also customize the width of the branding logo by setting a value for the `fullLogoWidth` field in the `branding` section, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
app:
  branding:
    fullLogoWidth: 110px <1>
# ...
----

<1> The default value for the logo width is `110px`. The following units are supported: `integer`, `px`, `em`, `rem`, percentage.
