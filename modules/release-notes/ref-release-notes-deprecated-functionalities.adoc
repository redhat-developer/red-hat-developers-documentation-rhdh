== Deprecation of dynamic imports with `import(...)`

The use of dynamic imports with `import(...)` has been deprecated and is no longer supported. The Backstage CLI supports native ESM in Node.js code, giving access to the importing of ESM-only packages. Therefore, you must now use `require(...)` as typeof `import(...)` when working with ESM or CommonJS packages.
