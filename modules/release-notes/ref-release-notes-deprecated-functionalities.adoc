[id="deprecated-functionality-rhidp-8525"]
== Deprecation of Bundled Plugin Wrappers

To enhance performance, decrease image size, and reduce maintenance, the method of including wrapped dynamic plugins within the main {product} container image was deprecated in {product-very-short} 1.7.
{product} is transitioning to a model where all dynamic plugins will be distributed as independent OCI artifacts.

This is a deprecation notice only; there are no breaking changes in 1.8. related to plugins, wrappers, or support for OCI artifacts. 
All previously bundled plugins will continue to be bundled in this release.

In {product-very-short} 1.9, the new OCI artifacts will be delivered, and community-supported plugins will no longer be distributed as bundled wrappers in the RHDH container image. These plugins will be built using GitHub Actions and published exclusively to the GitHub Container Registry (link:http://ghcr.io/).

In {product-short} 1.8 and earlier, community plugins are:

* Wrapped and bundled in the {product-short} container image.
* Referenced by using local paths, such as `./dynamic-plugins/dist/<plugin-name>`.

Starting with {product-short} 1.9, community plugins will be:

* Built using GitHub Actions from the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays[rhdh-plugin-export-overlays] repository.
* Published to `ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays`.
* Referenced by using OCI registry paths, such as `oci://ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/<plugin-name>:<tag>`.

The plugins in the following table will require the new OCI artifacts. The 1.9 documentation will provide guidance for your migration.
