== Deprecation of `podman` and `ImageStreams` approach for Helm chart mirroring on {ocp-short}

You are now required to transition to `oc-mirror` for Helm chart and related container image mirroring on {ocp-short}. This change enables support for fully disconnected and partially disconnected environments, ensuring a {company-name}-supported airgapping process.

== Change in sign-in resolver configuration location

Previously, configuring the sign-in resolver to bypass user provisioning in the {product-short} software catalog required setting `dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog: true` at the root of the `{my-app-config-file}` file.

In this release, this configuration has been deprecated at the root level and moved to the resolver configuration section. It now applies specifically to that resolver. For more details, see link:{authentication-book-url}[{authentication-book-title}].

[id="deprecated-functionality-rhidp-6013"]
== Deprecation of legacy dynamic plugin configurations and export options

Due to ongoing improvements in dynamic plugin functionality, the following features are deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

* `apiFactories` configuration: Dynamic plugins must now define API factories directly within their plugin using the `createPlugin` API for better integration and maintainability.

* `export-dynamic-plugin --embed-as-code` and `--no-embed-as-dependencies`: These options, which inline each dependency as code, have been deprecated because plugins exported this way cannot properly access the database. The `--embed-as-dependencies` option, now the default for package `export-dynamic-plugin`, replaces this behavior.
