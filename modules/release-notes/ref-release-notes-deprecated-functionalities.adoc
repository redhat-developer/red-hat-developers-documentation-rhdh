== Deprecation of Bundled Plugin Wrappers

To enhance performance, decrease image size, and reduce maintenance, the method of including &#34;wrapped&#34; dynamic plugins within the main {product} container image is being deprecated as of release 1.7.0. We are transitioning to a model where all dynamic plugins will be distributed as independent OCI artifacts.

For the 1.7.0 release, this is a deprecation notice only; there are no breaking changes, and all previously bundled plugins will continue to be bundled. However, we encourage customers to prepare for the removal of wrappers in a future release by beginning to use the new OCI artifacts in 1.8.0. Documentation will be updated to guide this migration.
