= The 'dynamic-plugins' config map is named dynamically

Before this update, the dynamic-plugins config map name was hardcoded.
Therefore, it was not possible to install two {product} helm charts in the same namespace.

With this update, the dynamic-plugins config map is named dynamically based on the deployment name similar to how all other components names are generated. 
When upgrading from a previous chart you might need to manually update that section of your `values.yaml` file to pull in the correct config map.
