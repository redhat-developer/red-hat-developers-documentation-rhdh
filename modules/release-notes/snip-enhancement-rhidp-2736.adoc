= Force catalog ingestion for production users

By default, it is now required for the user entity to exist in the software catalog to allow sign in. 
This is required for production ready deployments since identities need to exist and originate from a trusted source (i.e. the Identity Provider) in order for security controls such as RBAC and Audit logging to be effective. 
To bypass this, enable the `dangerouslySignInWithoutUserInCatalog` configuration that allows sign in without the user being in the catalog.
Enabling this option is dangerous as it might allow unauthorized users to gain access.
