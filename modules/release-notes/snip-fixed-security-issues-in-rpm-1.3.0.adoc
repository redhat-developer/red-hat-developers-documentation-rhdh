link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-35895[CVE-2024-35895]::
CVE-2024-35895 addresses a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) subsystem, specifically within the sockmap feature. The issue arises when BPF tracing programs, which can execute in various interrupt contexts, attempt to delete elements from sockmap or sockhash maps. This operation involves acquiring locks that are not safe for use in hard interrupt contexts, leading to potential deadlocks due to lock inversion.
BPF tracing programs may delete elements from sockmap/sockhash maps while running in interrupt contexts where the required locks are not hardirq-safe, causing possible deadlocks.

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-36016[CVE-2024-36016]::
A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's `n_gsm` driver, affecting the `tty` subsystem. It occurs when switching between basic and advanced option modes in GSM multiplexing, leading to potential out-of-bounds memory writes. This happens because certain state variables, like `gsm->len` and `gsm->state`, are not properly reset during mode changes. The issue could result in memory corruption.
