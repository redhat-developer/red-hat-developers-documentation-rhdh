= Fixed the timestamp inserted by `catalog:timestamping`

Before this update, the timestamp in the `catalog-info.yaml` created by the `catalog:timestamping` action by the `backstage-scaffolder-backend-module-annotator` plugin was different from the execution time of the template.

With this update,  a unique timestamp is generated on each execution of the template.
