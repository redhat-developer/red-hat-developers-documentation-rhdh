= Filtering for permissions policies that do not exist leads to an error being thrown

Before this update, permission checks by the permission framework would throw an error if a matching permission policy was not previously defined.
Therefore, {product-short} denied the request with an error.

With this update, {product-short} denies the request without throwing an error.
