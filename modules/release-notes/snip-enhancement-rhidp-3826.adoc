= Loading a custom Backstage theme from a dynamic plugin

With this update, you can load a custom Backstage theme from a dynamic plugin.

.Procedure

. Export a theme provider function in the dynamic plugin, such as:

[source,javascript]
----
import { lightTheme } from './lightTheme'; // some custom theme
import { UnifiedThemeProvider } from '@backstage/theme';
export const lightThemeProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => (
  <UnifiedThemeProvider theme={lightTheme} children={children} />
);
----

. Configure {product-short} to load the them in the UI by using the new `themes` configuration field:

[source,yaml]
----
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    example.my-custom-theme-plugin:
      themes:
        - id: light # <1>
          title: Light
          variant: light
          icon: someIconReference
          importName: lightThemeProvider
----
<1> Optionally, override the default Developer Hub themes specifying following id value: `light`overrides the default light theme and `dark` overrides the default dark theme.

.Verification
* The theme is available in the "Settings" page.


This update also introduced the ability to override core API service factories from a dynamic plugin, which can be helpful for more specialized use cases such as providing a custom ScmAuth configuration for the {prdouct-short} frontend.
