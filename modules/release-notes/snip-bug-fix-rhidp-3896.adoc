= Authenticate with GitHub a user absent in the software catalog when `dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog` is set to true

Before this update, authentication with Github failed when the `dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog` field was set to true and the user was absent from the software catalog.

With this update, when the `dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog` field is set to true, you can authenticate to {product-short} with a user absent from the software catalog.
