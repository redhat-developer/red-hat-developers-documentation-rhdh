= [Docs] Document Deployment customization configuration for Operator

This release includes an enhancement to the {product-short} Operator that exposes a`rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha2` API Version of its Custom Resource Definition (CRD). This CRD exposes a generic `spec.deployment.patch` field, which allows you to patch the {product-short} Deployment resource.
