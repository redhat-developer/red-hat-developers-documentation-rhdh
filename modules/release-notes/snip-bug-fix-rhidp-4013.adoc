= The {product-short} image defined in the custom resource takes precedence on the image defined in the environment variable

Before this update, when the {product-short} image was configured in both the custom resource and in the  'RELATED_IMAGE_backstage' environment variable, the image defined in the custom resource was not used. 

With this update, the custom resource configuration takes precedence and is applied.
