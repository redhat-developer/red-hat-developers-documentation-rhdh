[id="enhancement-rhidp-2200"]
== Added an individual `mountPath`

This update adds an individual `mountPath` for link:{configuring-book-url}#proc-mounting-additional-files-in-your-custom-configuration-using-rhdh-operator[extra ConfigMaps or Secrets].

[id="feature-rhidp-3621"]
== `PersistentVolumeClaims` support is available

With this update, link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#persistentvolumeclaims[`PersistentVolumeClaims` (PVC)] support is available.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-4384"]
== Enhanced use of `kube-rbac-proxy`

This update removes the `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar container from the RHDH Operator Pod. This sidecar container protected the operator metrics endpoint. However, the main container now provides this functionality out-of-the-box. Removing this sidecar container allows for reducing the resources required to run the Operator.

.`app-config.yaml` fragment with the `developerhub.flavor` field

[source,yaml,subs=&#34;+quotes&#34;]
----
developerHub:
  flavor: &lt;flavor&gt;
