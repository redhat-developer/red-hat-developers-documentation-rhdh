== Support for loading authentication providers from dynamic plugins

{product} {product-version} introduces support for loading authentication providers or modules from dynamic plugins, enabling greater flexibility and customization. The key improvements include:

* Environment variable control:
** A new `ENABLE_AUTH_PROVIDER_MODULE_OVERRIDE` environment variable determines whether the backend installs the default authentication provider module.
** When the new environment variable is enabled, dynamic plugins can be used to supply custom authentication providers.

* Custom sign-in page support:
+
--
** A new `signInPage` configuration allows front-end dynamic plugins to provide a custom `SignInPage` component.
+
.Example configuration
[source,yaml]
----
dynamicPlugins:
 frontend:
   my-plugin-package:
     signInPage:
       importName: CustomSignInPage
----

** The exported `CustomSignInPage` will be mapped to `components.SignInPage` during front-end initialization.
--

* Authentication provider settings:
+
--
** A new `providerSettings` configuration field allows front-end dynamic plugins to define authentication provider settings for display in the *Authentication Providers* tab on the *Settings* page.
+
.Example configuration
[source,yaml]
----
dynamicPlugins:
 frontend:
   my-plugin-package:
     providerSettings:
- title: Github Two
description: Sign in with GitHub Org Two
provider: core.auth.github-two
----

** Each `providerSettings` entry creates a corresponding row in the *Authentication Providers* tab. The provider field must match the string used in `createApiRef` when defining the API reference:
+
.Example configuration
[source,javascript]
----
export const ghTwoAuthApiRef: ApiRef<
 OAuthApi & ProfileInfoApi & BackstageIdentityApi & SessionApi
> = createApiRef({
 id: 'core.auth.github-two', // <--- this string
})
----
--

[source,yaml]
----
- mountPoint: home.page/cards
 importName: TopVisitedCard
 config:
   layouts:
     xl: { w: 6, h: 4 }
     lg: { w: 6, h: 4 }
     md: { w: 6, h: 4 }
     sm: { w: 6, h: 4 }
     xs: { w: 6, h: 4 }
     xxs: { w: 6, h: 4 }


- mountPoint: home.page/cards
 importName: RecentlyVisitedCard
 config:
   layouts:
     xl: { w: 6, h: 4, x: 6 }
     lg: { w: 6, h: 4, x: 6 }
     md: { w: 6, h: 4, x: 6 }
     sm: { w: 6, h: 4, x: 6 }
     xs: { w: 6, h: 4, x: 6 }
     xxs: { w: 6, h: 4, x: 6 }

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5815"]
== Improved rate limit handling for GitHub organization entity provider

The GitHub organization entity provider now manages both primary and secondary GitHub rate limits. It automatically pauses operations when these limits are reached, ensuring greater reliability, especially when ingesting large GitHub organizations.

[id="feature-rhidp-5814"]
== New configuration option for improved catalog performance

A new `catalog.disableRelationsCompatibility` configuration option has been introduced. Enabling this option enhances catalog performance and reduces memory usage. However, it may impact consumers that depend on the target field in relation objects.

[id="feature-rhidp-5813"]
== New Scaffolder permission for front-end template management

The `scaffolder.template.management` permission has been introduced to restrict access to front-end template management features, ensuring better control over template modifications. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/{product-version}/html-single/authorization/index#ref-rbac-permission-policies_title-authorization[Permission policies reference].

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5732"]
== Support for multi-replica RHDH with persistent volume for dynamic plugins cache

Previously, running multi-replica {product-very-short} with a persistent volume for the dynamic plugins cache was not possible due to potential write conflicts. {product-very-short} {product-version} mitigates that risk, allowing for better scalability and stability.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-4595"]
== Configurable PVC mounting for containers

Previously, the default Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) could only be mounted to the Backstage container. With this update, you can now configure which container(s) the PVC must be mounted to, providing greater flexibility in storage management.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-1450"]
== Improved status conditions for Backstage custom resources

This update enhances the status conditions in the Backstage custom resource(s) managed by the {product-short} Operator, providing clearer insights into application availability.

A new `DeployInProgress` reason has been introduced under the `Deployed` condition. It appears when the application is still starting up and not fully available. The `Deployed` reason now only reflects when the {product-short} application is fully up and running with the desired number of replicas, improving visibility during deployment. For example:

.Example status conditions
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time: 2025-03-10T17:09:22Z
    Message: Deployment status: Available: Deployment does not have minimum availability. Progressing: ReplicaSet "backstage-bs1-674476fd67" is progressing.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-4785"]
== Enhanced secret configuration for YAML files
{product-very-short} now introduces the ability to configure multiple secrets within a single YAML file, similar to PVCs. Additionally, it allows annotations to specify:

* The mount path for each secret
* The specific containers where the secret must be mounted

This enhancement provides greater flexibility in managing secrets across different containers.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5601"]
== Enhanced title customization options for the home page plugin

The home page plugin now provides more ways to customize and personalize the title. If your user catalog entity includes a `displayName`, the title can dynamically display your first name or display name for a more personalized experience.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5586"]
== Automatic platform detection for {product-short} Operator configuration

In this update, the {product-short} Operator has been enhanced to automatically detect the platform it is running on (such as EKS, AKS, or GKE) and apply the necessary patches to the fsGroup field in the security contexts of the containers.

This enhancement removes the need for manual updates to the Operator default configuration, simplifying the installation process and eliminating some post-installation steps.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5230"]
== Enhanced air-gapped installation script for {product-short} Operator

The installation script for the {product-short} Operator has been improved to support all link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/developerhub[supported platforms]. Additionally, it now works seamlessly in both partially disconnected and fully disconnected environments, making the setup process more versatile and accessible.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5231"]
== Enhanced role creation with bulk selection for users, groups, plugins, and permissions

This release introduces significant enhancements to the RBAC plugin, allowing administrators to select multiple users, groups, plugins, and their associated permissions at once when creating a role. Previously, this process was done individually, which could be time-consuming. Now, administrators can quickly select multiple items in a single action, simplifying and speeding up role and permission configuration.

Additionally, resource-based permissions now display more intuitive names, showing associated CRUD actions rather than just resource types, which improves visibility and usability.

These updates reduce manual effort, increase efficiency, and enhance the overall user experience when managing access control.
