[id="enhancement-rhidp-4384"]
== Enhanced use of `kube-rbac-proxy`

This update removes the `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar container from the RHDH Operator Pod. This sidecar container protected the operator metrics endpoint. However, the main container now provides this functionality out-of-the-box. Removing this sidecar container allows for reducing the resources required to run the Operator.

== Identifying Backstage flavor for plugins by using the `developerHub.flavor` field

With this update, you can use the `developerHub.flavor` field to identify whether plugins are running on {product-very-short}, {rhtap-very-short}, or vanilla Backstage, as shown in the following example:

.`app-config.yaml` fragment with the `developerhub.flavor` field

[source,yaml,subs=&#34;quotes&#34;]
----
developerHub:
  flavor: &lt;flavor&gt;;
----

`flavor`::
Identify the flavor of Backstage that is running. Default value: `rhdh`
