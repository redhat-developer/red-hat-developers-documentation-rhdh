= New features

This section highlights new features in {product} {product-version}.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-2200"]
== Added an individual `mountPath`

This update adds an individual `mountPath` for link:{configuring-book-url}#proc-mounting-additional-files-in-your-custom-configuration-using-rhdh-operator[extra ConfigMaps or Secrets].

[id="feature-rhidp-3621"]
== `PersistentVolumeClaims` support is available

With this update, link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#persistentvolumeclaims[`PersistentVolumeClaims` (PVC)] support is available.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-4384"]
== Enhanced use of `kube-rbac-proxy`

This update removes the `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar container from the RHDH Operator Pod. This sidecar container protected the operator metrics endpoint. However, the main container now provides this functionality out-of-the-box. Removing this sidecar container allows for reducing the resources required to run the Operator.

[id="feature-rhidp-4414"]
== Identifying Backstage flavor for plugins by using the `developerHub.flavor` field

With this update, you can use the `developerHub.flavor` field to identify whether plugins are running on {product-very-short}, {rhtap-very-short}, or vanilla Backstage, as shown in the following example:

.`app-config.yaml` fragment with the `developerhub.flavor` field

[source,yaml,subs=&#34;+quotes&#34;]
----
developerHub:
  flavor: &lt;flavor&gt;
----

`flavor`::
Identify the flavor of Backstage that is running. Default value: `rhdh`

[id="feature-rhidp-4419"]
== Ability to manage Persistent Volume Claim (PVCs) in {product-very-short} Operator

You can now mount directories from pre-created PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) using the `spec.application.extraFiles.pvcs` field, while configuring {product-very-short} Operator.
For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/{product-version}/html-single/configuring/index#configuring-the-deployment[Configuring {product} deployment when using the Operator].


[id="feature-rhidp-4805"]
== Authenticating with {rhbk-brand-name}

With this update, you can use {rhbk-brand-name} as an authentication provider. The Keycloak plugin will now support ingesting users and groups with {rhbk-brand-name}. For more details, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/{product-version}/html-single/authentication/index#assembly-authenticating-with-rhbk[Authenticating with {rhbk-brand-name}].

[id="feature-rhidp-4806"]
== Ability to install third-party plugins in {product-very-short}

You can now install third-party plugins in {product} without rebuilding the {product-very-short} application.

For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/{product-version}/html-single/installing_and_viewing_plugins_in_red_hat_developer_hub/index#assembly-install-third-party-plugins-rhdh[Installing third-party plugins in {product}].

[id="feature-rhidp-5156"]
==  The catalog backend module logs plugin is enabled

With this update, the `backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-logs` is enabled and converted to a static plugin improving performance and stability. The dynamic plugin was disabled in version `1.3`.

[id="feature-rhidp-5734"]
== {gke-brand-name} now supported

{gke-brand-name} ({gke-short}) is out of Developer Preview and is now fully supported as of {product-very-short} {product-version}.

See the full list of supported platforms on the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/developerhub[Life Cycle page].

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5834"]
== Manage concurrent writing when installing dynamic plugins


Previously, running multi-replica RHDH with a Persistent Volume for the Dynamic Plugins cache was not possible due to potential write conflicts. This update mitigates that risk.
