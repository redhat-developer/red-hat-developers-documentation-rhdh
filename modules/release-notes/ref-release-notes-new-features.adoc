[id="feature-rhidp-5814"]
== New configuration option for improved catalog performance

A new `catalog.disableRelationsCompatibility` configuration option has been introduced. Enabling this option enhances catalog performance and reduces memory usage. However, it may impact consumers that depend on the target field in relation objects.

[id="feature-rhidp-5813"]
== New Scaffolder permission for front-end template management

The `scaffolder.template.management` permission has been introduced to restrict access to front-end template management features, ensuring better control over template modifications. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/{product-version}/html-single/authorization_in_red_hat_developer_hub/index#ref-rbac-permission-policies_title-authorization[Permission policies reference].

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5732"]
== Support for multi-replica RHDH with persistent volume for dynamic plugins cache

Previously, running multi-replica {product-very-short} with a persistent volume for the dynamic plugins cache was not possible due to potential write conflicts. {product-very-short} {product-version} mitigates that risk, allowing for better scalability and stability.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-4595"]
== Configurable PVC mounting for containers

Previously, the default Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) could only be mounted to the Backstage container. With this update, you can now configure which container(s) the PVC must be mounted to, providing greater flexibility in storage management.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-1450"]
== Improved status conditions for Backstage custom resources

This update enhances the status conditions in the Backstage custom resource(s) managed by the {product-short} Operator, providing clearer insights into application availability.

A new `DeployInProgress` reason has been introduced under the `Deployed` condition. It appears when the application is still starting up and not fully available. The `Deployed` reason now only reflects when the {product-short} application is fully up and running with the desired number of replicas, improving visibility during deployment. For example:

.Example status conditions
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time: 2025-03-10T17:09:22Z

----

[id="enhancement-rhidp-4785"]
== Enhanced secret configuration for YAML files
The {product-very-short} Operator now introduces the ability to configure multiple secrets within a single YAML file, similar to PVCs. Additionally, it allows annotations to specify:

* The mount path for each secret
* The specific containers where the secret must be mounted

This enhancement provides greater flexibility in managing secrets across different containers.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5601"]
== Enhanced title customization options for the home page plugin

The home page plugin now provides more ways to customize and personalize the title. If your user catalog entity includes a `displayName`, the title can dynamically display your first name or display name for a more personalized experience.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5586"]
== Automatic platform detection for {product-short} Operator configuration

In this update, the {product-short} Operator has been enhanced to automatically detect the platform it is running on (such as EKS, AKS, or GKE) and apply the necessary patches to the fsGroup field in the security contexts of the containers.

This enhancement removes the need for manual updates to the Operator default configuration, simplifying the installation process and eliminating some post-installation steps.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5230"]
== Enhanced air-gapped installation script for {product-short} Operator

The installation script for the {product-short} Operator has been improved to support all link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/developerhub[supported platforms].

[id="enhancement-rhidp-5231"]
== Enhanced role creation with bulk selection for users, groups, plugins, and permissions

This release introduces significant enhancements to the RBAC plugin, allowing administrators to select multiple users, groups, plugins, and their associated permissions at once when creating a role. Previously, this process was done individually, which could be time-consuming. Now, administrators can quickly select multiple items in a single action, simplifying and speeding up role and permission configuration.

Additionally, resource-based permissions now display more intuitive names, showing associated CRUD actions rather than just resource types, which improves visibility and usability.

These updates reduce manual effort, increase efficiency, and enhance the overall user experience when managing access control.
