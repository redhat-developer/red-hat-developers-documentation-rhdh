= New features

This section highlights new features in {product} {product-version}.

[id="enhancement-rhdhbugs-1885"]
== Improved plugin configuration merging for include files

Previously, include plugin configuration files would overwrite existing files. With this update, {product} will merge configurations from existing include files, only overwriting specific keys while preserving keys defined in existing include files, mirroring the behavior for the `plugins` key.


[id="feature-rhidp-6628"]
== Dynamic plugin dependency management
{product} 1.7 adds dynamic plugin dependency management, so that the Operator can manage Kubernetes resources required by plugins.

For more information, see link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/blob/main/docs/dynamic-plugins.md#dynamic-plugins-dependency-management[Dynamic plugin dependency management]

[id="feature-rhidp-6633"]
== Added Orchestrator plugins with dependencies to {product-very-short} profile.
 
With this update, Orchestrator plugins with dependencies are added to the {product-very-short} profile. The Orchestrator plugin is disabled by default. When you enable the Orchestrator plugin, it will deploy dependencies and work out of the box on {product-very-short}.  

[id="enhancement-rhidp-6657"]
== Updated {product-very-short} theme

With this update, the `@redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-theme` package is replaced with the plugin version from the `rhdh-plugins` repository to improve theme integration and visual consistency. Minor UI enhancements include updated border radius on cards.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-6723"]
== Improved Role-based access control (RBAC) usability and consistency
This release includes several enhancements to improve the usability and consistency of the RBAC experience:

* Aligned the table height behavior in the &#34;Users and Groups&#34; step with the &#34;Permissions&#34; step.
* Standardized icon colors for edit and delete actions in tables.
* Simplified Overview page titles for users, groups, and permissions.
* Improved layout and labeling in the Conditional Access sidebar.
* Preserved typed input in search fields when selecting users, groups, or plugins.

These changes aim to create a more intuitive and seamless role management workflow.

[id="feature-rhidp-6758"]
== Introducing plugin management by using Extensions

In this release, {product-short} administrators can configure dynamic plugins directly within the Extensions UI. Administrators can now enable, disable, install, or edit the configuration of dynamic plugins on the Extensions Details Page.

This is an opt-in feature that must be enabled by configuration, and it is intended for testing and development environments only; it is not recommended for production use. 

This release requires a single replica deployment and uses a persistent volume claim (PVC) for the dynamic plugin configuration file. The {product-short} backend does not automatically restart when you save configuration changes. You must restart the {product-short} application for any dynamic plugin configuration updates to take effect.

[id="feature-rhidp-6963"]
== Dynamic plugins now fully supported and a new command-line tool released.

Backend dynamic plugins have reached General Availability (GA). A new command-line tool, `@red-hat-developer-hub/cli` (rhdh-cli), has been released for building and packaging these plugins. As a result, the `@janus-idp/cli` is now officially deprecated. All users should migrate their build processes to `@red-hat-developer-hub/cli` to maintain support and receive future updates.

[id="feature-rhidp-7018"]
== Quick start for platform engineers

{product-very-short} 1.7 introduces the new Administrator Quick Start guide, a feature designed to streamline the initial setup and configuration process for platform engineers. This guided, interactive experience appears automatically on an administrator&#39;s first login, providing clear, step-by-step instructions for essential platform tasks. The goal is to significantly reduce onboarding time and help you configure your {product-very-short}  instance with confidence.

Quick start tracks your progress, offers context-aware help that follows you across configuration pages, and can be dismissed and reopened from the header at any time. This guide ensures a confident, efficient, and structured onboarding experience. Note that when permissions are enabled, this feature is currently available for administrators only, with support for other roles planned for future versions.

[id="feature-rhidp-7106"]
== Improved global header UX

With this release, you can display a user avatar in the profile dropdown in the global header.

[id="feature-rhidp-7262"]
== Improved look and feel of {product-short}

With this update, the look and feel of {product-short} has been updated to better match the visual style of PatternFly 6 and improve alignment with the Red Hat product portfolio.

[id="feature-rhidp-7306"]
== Versioning for software templates

{product-very-short} has been enhanced to provide crucial traceability, allowing users to easily identify the template version used to create a specific component. This enhancement helps determine if an older entity needs updating or if a bug is linked to a particular template version.

Scaffolder templates can now be versioned using the backstage.io/template-version annotation and the `catalog:template:version` action. When used with the `catalog:template:version` action, the annotation of the template is applied to the generated catalog entity.

[id="feature-rhidp-7561"]
== Support for high availability in {eks-brand-name}

{product} now supports high availability setups in {eks-brand-name} ({eks-short}). This enhancement allows the deployment to scale beyond a single replica, ensuring the application remains operational and accessible even in the event of failures or disruptions.

For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.6/html-single/configuring_red_hat_developer_hub/index#HighAvailability[_Configuring high availability in Red Hat Developer Hub_].

[id="feature-rhidp-7610"]
== Adoption Insights in {product}

In this release, the Adoption Insights plugin is fully supported and enabled by default. The Adoption Insights plugin provides key metrics and trends to help you understand {product-short} usage. 

If you have an existing Adoption Insights plugin custom configuration with GitHub Container registry images already set up, you can upgrade to the latest version to omit configurations using GitHub Container registry images.

For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.6/html/adoption_insights_in_red_hat_developer_hub/index[Adoption Insights in Red Hat Developer Hub].

[id="feature-rhidp-7663"]
== {product-short} community plugins updated to Backstage 1.39

The {product-short} community plugins have been updated to Backstage version 1.39.

[id="enhancement-rhidp-8103"]
== Improved robustness of dynamic plugin installation

Previously, the {product} would fail to start if a specified include file in dynamic plugins configuration did not exist. This 
update addresses the issue by logging a warning and skipping the file if 
it&#39;s not found.
