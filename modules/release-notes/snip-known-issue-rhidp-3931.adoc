= [bulk-import][backend] Entities of repos under a configured org in catalog-backend-module-github-org plugin are not deleted from the catalog when the imported repo is deleted from bulk imports.

Repositories might be added to Developer Hub from various sources (like statically in an app-config file or dynamically when enabling GitHub discovery). By design, the bulk import plugin will only track repositories that are accessible from the configured GitHub integrations.
When both the Bulk Import and the GitHub Discovery plugins are enabled, the repositories the latter discovers might be listed in the Bulk Import pages.
However, attempting to delete a repository added by the discovery plugin from the Bulk Import Jobs may have no effect, as any entities registered from this repository might still be present in the Developer Hub catalog.
There is unfortunately no known workaround yet.
