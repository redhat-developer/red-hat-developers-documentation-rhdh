= Customizing the main navigation sidebar

This update introduces a configurable and customizable main navigation sidebar in {product-short}, offering administrators greater control over the navigation structure. Previously, the sidebar was hard-coded with limited flexibility, and dynamic plugins could only contribute menu items without control over their order or structure.

With this feature, administrators can now configure the order of navigation items, create nested sub-navigation, and provide users with a more organized and intuitive interface. This enhancement improves user experience and efficiency by allowing a more tailored navigation setup.

Backward compatibility is maintained, ensuring existing dynamic plugin menu item contributions remain functional. A default configuration is provided, along with example configurations, including one with an external dynamic plugin. Documentation has been updated to guide developers on customizing the navigation.
