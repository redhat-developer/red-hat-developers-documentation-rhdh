= Topology plugin permission does not show up in RBAC frontend UI

Some permissions that only have frontend plugins will not show up in the UI due to a requirement of needing a backend plugin to expose the permission framework's wellknow endpoint. As a workaround, you can either apply these permissions through the use of the CSV file or by directly calling the REST API of the RBAC backend plugin. Known plugins affected are Topology topology.view.read, Tekton tekton.view.read, ArgoCD argocd.view.read, and Quay quay.view.read.
