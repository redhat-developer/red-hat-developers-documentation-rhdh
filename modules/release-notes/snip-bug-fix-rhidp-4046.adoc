= Updated the search dropdown to display results for a large number of users or groups

Before this update, in the RBAC administration page, the members dropdown was not able to load a large number of users or groups.
Therefore, the {product-shot} administrator was not able to select required users or groups to add to the role. 

With this update, the dropdown displays initially up to 100 users or groups shown and updates the display once the user starts to search. The search happens across the whole data-set and displays the first 100 results. The user must refine their search to narrow the results to a list containing  the desired user or group.
Therefore, even with larger numbers or users/groups, the {product-short} administrator can add required users or groups to the role.
