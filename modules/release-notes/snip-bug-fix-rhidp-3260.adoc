= Renamed optional secret dynamic-plugins-npmrc in helm chart

Before this update, the Helm Chart was using an unversioned name for the dynamic-plugins-npmrc secret.
Therefore subsequent Helm deployments of the RHDH Helm Chart version 1.2.1 failed after the first deployment with an error that a secret named dynamic-plugins-npmrc exists and is not owned by the current release.

With this update, the Helm Chart creates and uses a dynamic-plugins-npmrc secret that is named in line with the other resources managed by the Helm Chart: `_<release-name>_-dynamic-plugins-npmrc`.
As a result, the Helm Chart does not fail on the previous error.
