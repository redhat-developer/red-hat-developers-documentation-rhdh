= HTTP error code 431 when an user is member of many groups

Before this update, {prod-short} API became unresponsive when a user was member of a high number of groups (more than 150) with aggregated relations.
Therefore, the user might have failed to authenticate.
Also, {prod-short} might have shown an error when opening the user entity in the UI.

With this update, {prod-short} can handle a user member of a high number of groups (more than 150) with aggregated relations.
