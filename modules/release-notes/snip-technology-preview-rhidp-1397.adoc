= Registering existing entities from multiple Git repositories simultaneously

With this update, you can register entities from multiple repositories simultaneously, without the need to register them individually.

For repositories without a `catalog-entity.yaml` file, the plugin creates a pull request.
Once the pull request is merged, {product-short} registers the entity in the software catalog.
