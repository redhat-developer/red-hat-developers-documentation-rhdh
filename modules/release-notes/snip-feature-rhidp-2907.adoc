= Customizing the Home page

With this update, you can customize the Home page in {product} by passing the data into the `app-config.yaml` file as a proxy. It is now possible to add, reorganize, and remove cards, including the search bar, quick access, headline, markdown, placeholder, catalog starred entities and featured docs that appear based on the plugins you have installed and enabled.
