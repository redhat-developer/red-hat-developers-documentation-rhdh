Deprecation warning: The backend.auth.keys config has been replaced by backend.auth.externalAccess"::

--
Due to changes to the backend service-to-service authentication, you will see a deprecation warning if you have set up your deployment to use the "backend.auth.keys" configured under "upstream.backstage.appConfig". This warning is harmless for now and no action is needed. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-2716[(RHIDP-2716)]

// IP addresses may appear in Application logs::
// +
// --
// There is the potential for IP addresses to appear in application audit logs if RHDH is deployed without a proxy. If there are concerns about the presence of IP addresses in application logs, take the following action:

// 1) Delete them from the areas where they are being collected.
// 2) To avoid further collection of PII in logs, it is recommended that you set up a reverse proxy in front of RHDH so the IP of the proxy is logged instead. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-2766[(RHIDP-2766)]
