This section lists known issues with {product} {product-version}:

Helm Chart upgrade release failing on Openshift Developer Console::
+
--
If you have installed {product-short} manually using the Helm CLI, the helm chart release upgrade fails in the OpenShift Developer Console. 

*Workaround*: You can use the Helm CLI to upgrade. If you still want to upgrade using the console, then a workaround is to select the Helm Chart version from the drop-down list and select the {product-short} version you want to upgrade to. Before performing this workaround, ensure that you save your `values.yaml` configuration file to some other location.

Issues with the {product-short} upgrade path using a persistent cache::
+
--
If you have configured a cache with the {product} and are planning to upgrade to its new version, ensure that you have deleted that cache. A new cache will be recreated after the upgrade.

--

`Events` plugin redesign in progress for the new backend system::
+
--
The `Events` plugin is not completely supported by the new backend system, and thus its usefulness is greatly reduced, if not completely broken.

A complete redesign of the `Events` plugin support for the new backend system is in progress, but the plugin is still not available for integration into this release of {product}. This limitation temporarily prevents third parties from fully using events in plugins or modules they want to provide as dynamic plugins for {product}.

--

Issues with the RBAC Plugin::
+
--
In the new backend system, automatically getting the IDs of all dynamically installed plugins is not possible. This means that the permissions of dynamic plugins supporting RBAC will not be automatically displayed in the RBAC UI.

*Workaround*: You can manually add a list of dynamic plugin IDs supporting RBAC in the {product-short} application configuration file.
