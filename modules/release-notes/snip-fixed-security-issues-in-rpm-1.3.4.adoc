A vulnerability has been found in the Python `venv` module and CLI. Path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment "activation" scripts, for example, "source venv/bin/activate". This flaw allows attacker-controlled virtual environments to run commands when the virtual environment is activated.
