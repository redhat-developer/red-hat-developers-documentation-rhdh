A vulnerability has been found in the Python `venv` module and CLI. Path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment "activation" scripts, for example, "source venv/bin/activate". This flaw allows attacker-controlled virtual environments to run commands when the virtual environment is activated.

A flaw was found in Python. The `urllib.parse.urlsplit()` and `urlparse()` functions improperly validated bracketed hosts (`[]`), allowing hosts that weren't IPv6 or IPvFuture compliant. This behavior was not conformant to RFC 3986 and was potentially vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) if a URL is processed by more than one URL parser.
