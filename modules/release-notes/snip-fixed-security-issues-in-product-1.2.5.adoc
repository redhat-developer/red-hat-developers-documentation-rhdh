link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-21529[CVE-2024-21529]::
A flaw was found in the dset package. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the dset function due to improper user input sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to inject a malicious object property using the built-in Object property __proto__, which is recursively assigned to all the objects in the program.

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-21536[CVE-2024-21536]::
A flaw was found in the http-proxy-middleware package. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) due to an UnhandledPromiseRejection error thrown by micromatch. This flaw allows an attacker to kill the Node.js process and crash the server by requesting certain paths.

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-21538[CVE-2024-21538]::
Versions of the package cross-spawn before 7.0.5 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper input sanitization. An attacker can increase the CPU usage and crash the program by crafting a very large and well crafted string.

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-24791[CVE-2024-24791]::
A flaw was found in Go. The net/http module mishandles specific server responses from HTTP/1.1 client requests. This issue may render a connection invalid and cause a denial of service.

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-37890[CVE-2024-37890]::
A flaw was found in the Node.js WebSocket library (ws). A request with several headers exceeding the 'server.maxHeadersCount' threshold could be used to crash a ws server, leading to a denial of service.

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-39249[CVE-2024-39249]::
A flaw was found in the async Node.js package. A Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack can potentially be triggered via the autoinject function while parsing specially crafted input.

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-43799[CVE-2024-43799]::
A flaw was found in the Send library. This vulnerability allows remote code execution via untrusted input passed to the SendStream.redirect() function.

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-43800[CVE-2024-43800]::
A flaw was found in serve-static. This issue may allow the execution of untrusted code via passing sanitized yet untrusted user input to redirect().

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-45590[CVE-2024-45590]::
A flaw was found in body-parser. This vulnerability causes denial of service via a specially crafted payload when the URL encoding is enabled.

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-48949[CVE-2024-48949]::
A flaw was found in the Elliptic package. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass EDDSA signature validation via improper handling of signature values where the S() component of the signature is not properly checked for being non-negative or smaller than the curve order.
