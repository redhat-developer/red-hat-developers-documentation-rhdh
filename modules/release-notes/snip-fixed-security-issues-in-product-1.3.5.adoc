= {product} dependency updates

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-22150[CVE-2025-22150]::
A flaw was found in the undici package for Node.js. Undici uses `Math.random()` to choose the boundary for a multipart/form-data request. It is known that the output of `Math.random()` can be predicted if several of its generated values are known. If an app has a mechanism that sends multipart requests to an attacker-controlled website, it can leak the necessary values. Therefore, an attacker can tamper with the requests going to the backend APIs if certain conditions are met.
