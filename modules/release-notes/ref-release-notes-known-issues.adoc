== ArgoCD plugin permission and Quay plugin permission are not displayed in the RBAC front-end UI

Permissions associated only with front-end plugins do not appear in the UI because they require a backend plugin to expose the permission framework&#39;s well-known endpoint. As a workaround, you can apply these permissions by using a CSV file or directly calling the REST API of the RBAC backend plugin. Affected plugins include ArgoCD (`argocd.view.read`) and Quay (`quay.view.read`).
