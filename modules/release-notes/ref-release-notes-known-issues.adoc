== Topology plugin permission does not show up in rbac frontend ui

Permissions associated only with front-end plugins do not appear in the UI because they require a backend plugin to expose the permission framework&#39;s well-known endpoint. As a workaround, you can apply these permissions by using a CSV file or directly calling the REST API of the RBAC backend plugin. Affected plugins include Topology (`topology.view.read`), Tekton (`tekton.view.read`), ArgoCD (`argocd.view.read`), and Quay (`quay.view.read`).
