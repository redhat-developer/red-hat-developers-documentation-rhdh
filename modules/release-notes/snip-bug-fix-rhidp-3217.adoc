= rhtap installation always failed at RHDH due to Migration table is already locked

Before this update, after updating a config map or a secret, when pods where restarting to apply the changes, they might have tried to simultaneous lock the database.
The situation ended with a dead lock.

With this update, {product-short} handles simultaneous pod refreshing without a dead lock.
