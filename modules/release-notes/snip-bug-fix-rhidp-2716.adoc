= Replaced the deprecated `backend.auth.keys` field in the default configuration

Before this update, in a {product-short} deployment with the default configuration, the application logs displayed the deprecation warning.

With this update, the default `upstream.backstage.appConfig` configuration uses the `backend.auth.externalAccess` field rather than the deprecated `backend.auth.keys` field. 
Therefore, when you have set up your deployment to use the default configuration, the application logs do not display this warning.
