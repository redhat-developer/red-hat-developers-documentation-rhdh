= Replaced the deprecated `backend.auth.keys` field in the default configuration

Before this update, in a {prod-short} deployment with the default configuration, the application logs displayed the following warning:

----
Deprecation warning:  The backend.auth.keys config has been replaced by backend.auth.externalAccess"
----

With this update, the default `upstream.backstage.appConfig` configuration uses the `backend.auth.externalAccess` field rather than the deprecated `backend.auth.keys` field. 
Therefore, when you have set up your deployment to use the default configuration, the application logs do not display this warning.
