= Huge icon when techdoc text is selected, and broken reporting feature

Previously, the feature to report a documentation (techdoc) issue didn't work.

When the user selects a text in a techdoc it shows a huge icon instead of a tooltip-button.

The latest version contains a fix for this so the user can select some content in their documentation to report an issue there.
