= Breaking changes in Backstage release 1.29

.Backend System deprecations and removals

As part of the work towards a stable 1.0 release of the new backend system, there are several new deprecations and breaking changes in the backend system packages:

.Removed features
*  The deprecated `token` option has been removed from `PermissionsService`, and the request options are now required and must contain a `credentials` object.
*  The deprecated `getPath` option has been removed from `httpRouterServiceFactory`, the plugin paths are now always `/api/<pluginId>`.
*  It is no longer possible to pass service factory callbacks to the `defaultServiceFactories` option of  `createSpecializedBackend`.

.Deprecated features
* The ability to define options for service factories through `createServiceFactory` has been deprecated. See the service architecture documentation for more information on how to define customizable services.
* The ability to install backend features in callback form, i.e. `() => BackendFeature`, has been deprecated. This also includes other usages such as `startTestBackend`, and dynamically imported backend features. No manual changes should be needed for this change, as all backend feature creators have been updated to return `BackendFeature` instances directly.
* The `ServiceFactoryTest.get` method has been renamed to `ServiceFactoryTest.getSubject`, and is now deprecated.
* The following types have been renamed to use an `*Options` suffix instead: `ServiceRefConfig`, `RootServiceFactoryConfig`, `PluginServiceFactoryConfig`.
* Deprecated all exports related to the legacy status checker in `@backstage/backend-common`.
* The `isDockerDisabledForTests` function exported by `@backstage/backend-test-utils` has been deprecated.


.Catalog LDAP Module improvements

The `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-ldap` module has been improved to support multiple or no declarations of both user and group configs.

This change is breaking for `readLdapOrg` and `LdapProviderConfig`, which now both always accept arrays of users and groups configurations.
