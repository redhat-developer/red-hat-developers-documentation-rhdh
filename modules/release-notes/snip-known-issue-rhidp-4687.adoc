= Updating Channel does not trigger an Operator Update

Administrators cannot update RHDH across channels. As a workaround, to upgrade across channels:

* Delete the subscription by starting `CSV: 1.y.z` from the `fast-1.y` channel.
* Create a new subscription pointing to the new channel (fast or `fast-1.y+1`), using the latest CSV or a different startingCSV.
* Once installed, any existing Backstage objects will be upgraded through the new operator.

Note, your app config may need to be adjusted as part of the rollout, if plugins have changed their name or configuration requirements.
