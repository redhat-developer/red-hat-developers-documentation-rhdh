      This section lists Technology Preview features in {product} {product-version}.

      [IMPORTANT]
      ====
      Technology Preview features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling you to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
      However, these features are not fully supported under Red Hat Subscription Level Agreements, may not be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use.
      As Red Hat considers making future iterations of Technology Preview features generally available, we will attempt to resolve any issues that customers experience when using these features.
      See: link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview support scope].

    description: |
      This section lists Developer Preview features in {product} {product-version}.

      [IMPORTANT]
      ====
      Developer Preview features are not supported by Red Hat in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready.
      Do not use Developer Preview features for production or business-critical workloads. Developer Preview features provide
      early access to functionality in advance of possible inclusion in a Red Hat product offering. Customers can use these features
      to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. Developer Preview features might not have any
      documentation, are subject to change or removal at any time, and have received limited testing. Red Hat might provide ways
      to submit feedback on Developer Preview features without an associated SLA.
      For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Developer Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/devpreview/[Developer Preview Support Scope].
