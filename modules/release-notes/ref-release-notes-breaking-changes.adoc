== [Docs] Metrics:  Document the support for exposing metrics for customers related to critical functionalities in RHDH

Breaking change.

Prom-client metrics have been removed and replaced with OpenTelemetry metrics. As a result, the metrics port has changed from 7007 to 9464.    Deprecated metrics have also been removed. If you had dependencies on these, ensure your prometheus queries are updated. For further information see &lt;link to observability/monitoring and logging docs&gt;
