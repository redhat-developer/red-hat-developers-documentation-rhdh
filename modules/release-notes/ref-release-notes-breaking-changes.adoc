== Updated monitoring and logging metrics

Prom-client metrics have been removed and replaced with OpenTelemetry metrics. As a result, the metrics port has changed from `7007` to `9464`. Deprecated metrics have also been removed. If you had dependencies on these, ensure your prometheus queries are updated.
