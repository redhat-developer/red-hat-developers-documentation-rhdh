= Bulk Import: Added repositories count is incorrect

Only the first 20 repositories (in alphabetical order) can be displayed at most on the Bulk Import Added Repositories page. Also, the count of Added Repositories displayed might be wrong. In future releases, we plan to address this with proper pagination. Meanwhile, as a workaround, searching would still work against all Added Repositories. So you can still search any Added Repository and get it listed on the table.
