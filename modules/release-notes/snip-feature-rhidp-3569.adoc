= Restarting {product} faster

Before this update, it took a long time for {product-short} to restart because {product-short} bootstraps all dynamic plugins from zero with every restart. 

With this update, {product-short} is using persisted volumes for the dynamic plugins.
Therefore, {product-short} restarts faster.
