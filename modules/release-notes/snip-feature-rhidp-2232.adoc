= Customizing the deployment by using the custom resource

With this update, when deploying {product} by using the operator, you can configure the {product-short} Deployment resource.
The {product-short} Operator Custom Resource Definition (CRD) API Version has been updated to `rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha2`.
This CRD exposes a generic `spec.deployment.patch` field, which allows you to patch the {product-short} Deployment resource.
