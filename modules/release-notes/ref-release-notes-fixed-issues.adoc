=== Fixed incorrect user name display in Profile dropdown

Resolved an issue where the Profile drop-down in the Global Header displayed &#34;Guest&#34; instead of the logged-in user&#39;s name when using OIDC authentication. The drop-down now correctly shows the user&#39;s display name by checking `spec.profile.displayName`, then `metadata.title`, and now falling back to the name shown on the Profile card in the Settings page if neither is available.

==Known issue in 1.5.0 and 1.5.1:
The app-config configuration app.branding.iconLogo was not used as Favicon in the browser anymore.

= Fixed favicon not reflecting custom branding configuration

In versions 1.5.0 and 1.5.1, the `app.branding.iconLogo` value in the `app-config` was not applied as the browser favicon. This issue has been resolved in 1.5.2, and the configured branding icon now correctly appears as the favicon.

===  Improved startup speed with updated init container image pull policy for {product-short} Helm Chart

With this update, the pull policy for the init container image of the {product-short} Helm Chart was changed from `Always` to `IfNotPresent`. This change reduces the repeated download time during startup of the container image, which is approximately 2.5 GB, thereby significantly improving startup speed for users.

===  Improved Authentication for Self-Hosted Enterprise SCM Providers

Previously, actions requiring access to a self-hosted enterprise SCM provider failed, returning an error that no authentication provider was available for the specified host.

With this update, the SCM integration correctly identifies and uses the configured authentication provider for the corresponding enterprise host.

=== Customizable image names for job and data index services in {product-short} Helm Chart

Previously, when deploying the {product-short} Helm Chart with the Orchestrator enabled, it was not possible to customize the image names of the job and data index services, for example in disconnected environments. Setting the `orchestrator.sonataflowPlatform.jobServiceImage` and `orchestrator.sonataflowPlatform.dataIndexImage` would return a schema validation error from Helm. This update fixes this issue.

=== Network policy installation fix for {product-short} RHDH Helm Chart with Orchestrator flavor

Before this update, the {product-short} RHDH Helm Chart would not install Network Policies when the Orchestrator flavor was deployed with `serverlessLogicOperator` disabled, preventing the {product-short} Pods from being completely available. This update fixes this situation by installing network policies unconditionally when the orchestrator is enabled.

=== Resolved SonataFlow Pod Crash Issue

In the new release, a timing problem during the RHDH 1.7 installation with Orchestrator plugins, affecting SonataFlow database provisioning, has been addressed. This issue caused SonataFlow pods to repeatedly enter the `CrashLoopBackOff` state, leading to delays and potential confusion for users. With this update, SonataFlow pods no longer encounter the `CrashLoopBackOff` state due to the database provisioning delay. This improvement enhances the user experience, as SonataFlow pods now start promptly, eliminating unnecessary wait times.

=== Fixed SCM integration failures for self-hosted enterprise SCM providers

Previously, SCM integration failed for self-hosted enterprise SCM providers because the system could not identify the configured host. This resulted in a _No auth provider available_ error. With this release, the SCM integration now correctly uses the configured authentication provider for the corresponding enterprise host. As a result, end users can now successfully perform actions requiring enterprise SCM access.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-2250"]
=== Fixed incorrect version detection for local plugin updates

Before this update, local plugins within the image were incorrectly detected for updates due to version misidentification. This led to users being unable to update local plugins from wrappers, resulting in outdated functionality. With this release, local plugin updates are now automatically detected, eliminating the need for manual adjustments and ensuring seamless plugin version updates for end users.
