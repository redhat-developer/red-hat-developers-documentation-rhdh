[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-2117"]
=== Fixed incorrect version detection for local plugin updates

Before this update, the SCM integration failed due to lack of identification of the configured authentication provider for self-hosted enterprise SCM hosts. As a consequence, users experienced failed actions with self-hosted enterprise SCM providers due to missing authentication. With this release, the SCM integration now correctly uses the configured authentication provider for corresponding enterprise host. As a result, end users can now successfully perform actions requiring enterprise SCM access.

=== Fixed incorrect version detection for local plugin updates

Before this update, local plugins within the image were incorrectly detected for updates due to version misidentification. This led to users being unable to update local plugins from wrappers, resulting in outdated functionality. With this release, local plugin updates are automatically detected, eliminating the need for manual adjustments and ensuring seamless plugin version updates for end users.

=== Fixed documentation header column translation issue

Before this update, the header column on the documentation page lacked translations, causing wrong header labels for end users. This issue led to end users seeing `table.header.actions` on the documentation page. With this release, the header column correctly translates to `Actions`, making sure the end users see the correct label on the documentation page.

=== Fixed database service name error to make sure {product-very-short} instance starts correctly

Before this update, deploying Helm-based Orchestrator with local Database in replication mode failed due to a wrong database service name. This caused the {product-very-short} instance to fail to start. With this release, the {product-very-short} instance starts correctly, allowing the correct setting of the database service name in the {product-very-short} instance configuration.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-2041"]
=== Orchestrator plugin updated to 1.7.1

Before this update, the latest Orchestrator feature set was unavailable because the release included the outdated Orchestrator plugin version `1.6`. This issue is resolved in {product-very-short} `1.7.1`. The Orchestrator plugin is updated to version `1.7.1`, making sure that users have access to the latest features and functionality.

=== Excessive queries to the `relations` database table from the `rbac-backend` plugin

Before this update, excessive queries from the `rbac-backend` plugin to the `relations` database table caused performance issues. As a consequence, users experienced slow performance. With this release, the RBAC backend plugin has been optimized to improve performance by preventing excessive queries to the &#39;relations&#39; database table.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-503"]
=== The Operator reverts the number of replicas set automatically by a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

Previously the {product-very-short} Operator enforced `replicas: 1` from its default deployment config, which overrode scaling decisions. 

With this update, `replicas: 1` is removed from the default deployment profile and the DB-statefulset manifest. 

This update allows HPA to control scaling as expected, so that {product-very-short} instances can now scale dynamically with HPA without being reset by the operator.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-512"]
=== Improved error messaging for bulk imports

Before this update, when users selected 100 or more repositories simultaneously, the create pull request action could fail with a generic error message. In this release, we provide a more informative error message when creating pull requests for multiple repositories. This bug fix helps users to understand the issue by providing more information about what caused the error.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-622"]
=== Excessive authorize requests generated by the RBAC backend API

Before this update, excessive authorize requests in the REST API for creating/editing roles, permissions, and conditions in rbac-backend led to performance issues. With this release, the excessive authorization requests in the REST API have been fixed by reducing permissions to only &#39;user&#39; credentials.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-632"]
=== Custom title not persisting on refresh of visited cards

Previously, the custom title set via `app.title` in the _Top Visited_ and _Recently Visited_ cards did not persist after a page refresh, instead it defaulted back to _{product}_.

With this update, after each refresh, the cards correctly display the custom title defined in the `app.title` configuration.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-834"]
=== Fixed role name updates through API to correctly propagate to permissions, metadata, and conditions

Previously, when a role name was updated using the RBAC API, existing permissions, conditions, and metadata were not updated and remained mapped to the old role name.
With this update, role name changes are now correctly updated.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-903"]
=== Fixed role actions tooltip delay issue

Previously, tooltips on action icons in the *Role list* table of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) page were slow to appear on hover.

This issue has been fixed, ensuring that tooltips now appear immediately when hovering over action icons in the RBAC page.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-1110"]
=== The Extensions catalog does not show an error when the backend plugin is not installed

Previously, if the backend Extensions was not installed, {product-very-short} showed the skeleton &#34;forever&#34; instead of an error message.

With this update, the UI shows an empty state with a message to enable the backend plugin.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-1139"]
=== Fixed Profile dropdown showing Guest instead of user&#39;s name with OIDC authentication 

Previously, the *Profile dropdown* in the Global Header showed `Guest` instead of the logged-in user’s display name when logging in using the OIDC authentication.

With this release, the *Profile dropdown* correctly displays the user&#39;s name by first checking `spec.profile.displayName`, then `metadata.title`, and finally falls back to the name shown on the *Profile card* in the *Settings* page if neither is available.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-1162"]
=== Excessive filter arguments generated by the RBAC backend `enforcerDelegate.getFilteredPolicy`

Before this update, {product-very-short} performance was affected by the duplication of filter arguments in `enforcerDelegate.getFilteredPolicy`.  With this release, the duplication of filter arguments in `enforcerDelegate.ts` is avoided.

[id="bug-fix-rhdhbugs-1213"]
=== Fixed Jenkins permissions not being displayed in RBAC UI

Previously, Jenkins permissions were not exposed by Jenkins at `/api/jenkins/.well-known/backstage/permissions/metadata` with the change to `JenkinsBuilder`. As a result, RBAC UI did not display the permissions. In this release, users can configure Jenkins permissions by using the RBAC UI.
