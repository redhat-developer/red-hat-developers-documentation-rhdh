[id="bug-fix-rhidp-5731"]
=== Updated the air-gapped installation guide for non-OpenShift platforms

Previously, {product} documentation did not highlight the {product-short} installation using Helm Chart in fully and partially air-gapped environments on supported Kubernetes platforms.

With this update, the documentation provides instructions for mirroring required container images, updating Helm values, and installing the chart, without relying on internet access.

=== Line wrapping enabled for long menu heading labels

Previously, menu items with long text such as _Platform Engineer Services_ were cut off in the sidebar menu. With this update, line wrapping has been enabled for long menu heading labels, preventing the trimming and ensuring full text visibility.

=== Dynamic favicon configuration in `app-config.yaml` is not displayed on the login page

Before this update, the app-config configuration `app.branding.iconLogo` was not applied as the favicon in the browser.

This issue has been fixed, and the app-config configuration `app.branding.iconLogo` now correctly sets the favicon in the browser.

=== Floating Action Button (FAB) positioned in the &#39;Bottom-Left&#39; slot on {product-short}

Previously, the Floating Action Button (FAB) appeared over the navigation sidebar when the slot was set to &#39;bottom-left&#39;. This placement obstructed access to navigation elements, potentially hindering user interaction.

With this update, the FAB&#39;s position is adjusted to render adjacent to the navigation for the &#39;bottom-left&#39; slot position. As a result, users can access navigation options without obstruction.

=== Manually added resolutions override resolutions added by `--suppress-native-package`

Earlier, the `export-dynamic-plugin` command did not overwrite manually added resolutions, which could result in incorrect package dependencies in the exported dynamic plugin.

With this update, the `package export-dynamic-plugin` overwrites manually added resolutions, ensuring backstage dependencies are hoisted and native dependencies are suppressed from the exported dynamic plugin.
