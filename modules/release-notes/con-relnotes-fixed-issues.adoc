This section lists fixed issues with {product} {product-version}:

Dynamic plugins fail to load after update to Backstage 1.25::
+
--
An upstream security fix introduced in Backstage 1.25 required authentication tokens for all backend endpoints, including static assets used by dynamic plugins.

As a result of this fix, users could not access dynamic plugin UI elements, leading to a degraded user experience and decreased functionality within the application.

In this release, the security requirement for dynamic plugin static assets has been removed, which restores access to dynamic plugin UI elements.

Following the implementation of this fix, users can view and interact with dynamic plugin UI elements, resulting in improved usability and functionality within the application. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-2044[(RHIDP-2044)]
--

API throwing error upon adding conditions for scaffolder-action resource-type::
+
--
In earlier versions of {product}, defining conditional policies with a policy action of 'use' would result in an error.

This issue led to difficulties in defining conditional policies, hindering the configuration of permissions within the application.

With this fix, you can now define conditional policies in {product-short} with permission policy actions of 'use'. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-2237[(RHIDP-2237)]
--

Setting a custom route not working when using the {product-short} Operator on OpenShift::
+
--
In earlier versions of the {product} Operator, setting a custom Route host on OpenShift Container Platform by using the `spec.application.route.host` field in the Custom Resource was not possible.

    This limitation prevented users from configuring custom Route hosts, limiting their ability to customize the deployment environment.

With this release, you can now set a custom Route host on OpenShift Container Platform by using the specified field in the Custom Resource. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-2325[(RHIDP-2325)]
--

Mounting a secret/configmap with a '.' in its name::
+
--
In earlier versions of the {product} Operator, it was not possible to reference a ConfigMap or Secret object in the Custom Resource if that object contained a dot (`.`) character in its name. 

This issue prevented the {product} instance from starting correctly.

With this update, this issue is fixed. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-2246[(RHIDP-2246)]
--

Upgrading {product-short} Operator from 1.1 to 1.2 causes an existing instance use a new empty database::
+
--
When upgrading the {product} Operator from version 1.1 to 1.2 with an already-running operator-backed instance of {product-short}, the instance was configured to use a new empty local database pod and volume. 

The existing database data was retained but this misconfiguration caused the existing {product-short} instance to use a new empty local database pod and volume, resulting in data redundancy and potential data inconsistency issues.

This update ensures that an existing {product-short} instance continues to use the existing local database when the Operator is upgraded to a newer version. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-2434[(RHIDP-2432)]
--

UI pod stays 'Pending' when using the operator::
+
--
In earlier versions of {product}, the {product-short} pod created by the (product-short) Operator may not be scheduled on some clusters due to missing resource requests.

This issue resulted in the {product-short} application being unavailable as the pods could not be scheduled properly.

This update adds CPU and memory requests to the default configuration of the Operator, ensuring that {product-short} pods have the necessary resource requests specified.

With this fix, {product-short} pods can now be scheduled and started properly on all clusters, ensuring the availability of the {product} application. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-2159[(RHIDP-2159)]
--

Allow specifying image pull secrets in Custom Resource for the database::
+
--
In earlier versions of the {product} operator, specifying image pull secrets to pull container images from private repositories such as `registry.redhat.io` did not affect the Database image. This limitation prevented the use of a database image from `registry.redhat.io`` when deploying {product-short} in non-OpenShift clusters like Amazon EKS or Azure AKS.

As a result, users were unable to deploy the database image from `registry.redhat.io` in non-OpenShift clusters, limiting deployment flexibility and compatibility.

This update fixes the issue by propagating the image pull secrets specified in the `spec.application.imagePullSecrets` Custom Resource field. You can now use these secrets can for both the {product-short} and database images.

With this fix, users can successfully use image pull secrets for both the {product-short} and database images, allowing deployments from private repositories such as `registry.redhat.io` in non-OpenShift clusters like Amazon EKS or Azure AKS. This ensures greater deployment flexibility and compatibility across different environments. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-1484[(RHIDP-1484)]
--

RBAC tab is visible when RBAC plugin is disabled::
+
--
In earlier versions of {product} When the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) plugin is disabled, the RBAC tab remained visible bwhen the RBAC plugin was disabled.

This update ensures that the RBAC tab is hidden when the RBAC plugin is disabled.

With this fix, the RBAC tab is no longer visible when the RBAC plugin is disabled, resulting in a cleaner and more intuitive user interface. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-1449[(RHIDP-1449)]

This section lists fixed security issues with {product} {product-version}:

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-35195[CVE-2024-35195]::
An incorrect control flow implementation vulnerability was found in Requests. If the first request in a session is made with `verify=False`, all subsequent requests to the same host will continue to ignore cert verification. link:xxxx[RHIDP-1343]

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-27307[CVE-2024-27307]::
A vulnerability was found in JSONata. A malicious expression can exploit the transform operator to override properties on the Object constructor and prototype. This issue can result in denial of service, remote code execution, or other unforeseen behavior in applications that assess user-provided JSONata expressions. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-1524[RHIDP-1524]

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-34064[CVE-2024-34064]::
A flaw was found in jinja2. The `xmlattr filter` accepts keys containing non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, /, >, or =, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could inject other attributes and perform cross-site scripting (XSS). link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-2315[RHIDP-2315]

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45288[CVE-2023-45288]::
A vulnerability was discovered with the implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol in the Go programming language. There were insufficient limitations on the amount of CONTINUATION frames sent within a single stream. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-2760[RHIDP-2760]

link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-27316[CVE-2024-27316]::
A vulnerability was found in how Apache httpd implements the HTTP/2 protocol. There are insufficient limitations placed on the amount of CONTINUATION frames that can be sent within a single stream. This issue could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send packets to vulnerable servers, which could use up memory resources to cause a Denial of Service. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-2327[RHIDP-2327]
