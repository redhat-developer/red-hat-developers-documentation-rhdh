This section lists fixed issues with {product} {product-version}:

Fix an inability to dynamically load a number of upstream backend plugins::
+
--
Before this release, a whole category of upstream or third-party backstage backend plugins could not be loaded dynamically when converted to dynamic plugins. Impacted plugins were those using the `resolvePackagePath()` backstage API method. This issue impacted most of the backend plugins using the database service and providing migration scripts.
This release removes such an important limitation of the dynamic plugin feature.
--

Incorrect configuration in the Atlassian Auth provider::
+
--
Before this release, the authorization URL was constructed as `${baseUrl}/oauth/authorize`, which did not align with the Atlassian expected path, resulting in an authentication error. Now, the users are directed to the authorization URL to get an authorization code for successful authentication.
--

RBAC: CSV repopulates the database whenever there is a server restart::
+
--
Before this release, the `policy.csv file` was used to load permissions into {product-short}. There might be instances of overlapping permissions, and the permissions could be reloaded into the database. 

--

Validation is not working for the `Create Role` API::
+
--
Before this release, the validation process in the `Create Role` API was ineffective, allowing the creation of roles that were invalid. This resulted in input errors when attempting to update or delete these roles. 

--

RBAC backend plugin: policy change requires server restart::
+
--
Before this release, manually manipulating the `policy.csv` file led to inconsistent behavior, causing the manipulated permission or role to not apply correctly within the RBAC plugin. 

--

No support for monitoring {product} plugins::
+
--
Before this release, no support was provided to administrators for monitoring {product} plugins. With this release, administrators can generate a list of {product-short} plugins and their versions for monitoring purposes.
