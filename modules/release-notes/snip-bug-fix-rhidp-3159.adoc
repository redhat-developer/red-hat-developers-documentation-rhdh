= The last ~10 GitHub Pull Requests are missing from the list

Before this update, {product-short} ignored GitHub search API restrictions to list pull requests.
Therefore, {product-short} might have not displayed all pull requests.

With this update, {product-short} limits paging to max 1000 results to respect GitHub search API restrictions.
{product-short} show users when additional results are available, suggesting in a tooltip that they can refine their query to retrieve more specific results.
