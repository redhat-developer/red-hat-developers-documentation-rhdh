= Language persistence

When you change the language in the UI, your preference is saved to storage. On next login or refresh, your chosen language setting is restored. Guest users cannot persist language preferences.

Default language selection uses the following priority order:

. *Browser language priority*: The system first checks the user's browser language preferences to provide a personalized experience.

. *Configuration priority*: If no browser language matches the supported locales, the `defaultLocale` from the `i18n` configuration is used as a fallback.

. *Fallback priority*: If neither browser preferences nor configuration provide a match, defaults to `en`.

Red Hat Developer Hub automatically saves and restores user language settings across browser sessions. This feature is enabled by default and uses database storage. To opt-out and use browser storage instead, add the following to your `{my-app-config-file}` configuration file:
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
userSettings:
  persistence: browser # <1>
----
<1> To opt-out and use browser local storage, set this value to `browser`. Optionally, set this value to `database` to persist across browsers and devices. This the default setting and does not require this configuration to be set.
