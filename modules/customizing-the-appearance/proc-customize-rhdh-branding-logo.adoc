= Customizing the branding logo of your {product-short} instance

You can customize the branding logo of your {product-short} instance by configuring the `branding` section in the `{my-app-config-file}` file, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
app:
  branding:
    fullLogo: ${BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO} <1>
    iconLogo: ${BASE64_EMBEDDED_ICON_LOGO} <2>
----

where:

<1> `fullLogo` is the logo on the expanded (pinned) sidebar and expects a base64 encoded image.
<2> `iconLogo` is the logo on the collapsed (unpinned) sidebar and expects a base64 encoded image.
+
You can format the `BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO` environment variable as follows:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO: "data:_<media_type>_;base64,_<base64_data>_"
----
+
The following example demonstrates how to customize the `BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO` using the `data:_<media_type>_;base64,_<base64_data>_` format:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
SVGLOGOBASE64=$(base64 -i logo.svg)
BASE64_EMBEDDED_FULL_LOGO="data:image/svg+xml;base64,$SVGLOGOBASE64"
----
Replace `image/svg+xml` with the correct media type for your image (for example, `image/png` and `image/jpeg`), and adjust the file extension accordingly. As a result, you can embed the logo directly without referencing an external file.

You can also customize the width of the branding logo by setting a value for the `fullLogoWidth` field in the `branding` section, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
app:
  branding:
    fullLogoWidth: 110px <1>
# ...
----

<1> The default value for the logo width is `110px`. The following units are supported: `integer`, `px`, `em`, `rem`, percentage.
