= Enabling Quicklinks and Starred Items after an upgrade

If you upgrade from {product} `1.6` or earlier, {product} does not automatically enable the *Quicklinks* and *Starred Items* features. You must manually configure these features to display them in the global header.

.Prerequisites

. You have access to your {product} configuration files.
. You have administrative permissions to modify ConfigMaps (if using the Operator).

.Procedure

. Locate your `dynamic-plugin` configuration.

* Operator deployment: The configuration is stored in a ConfigMap referenced by your Backstage custom resource (CR).
* Helm deployment: The configuration is in your `values.yaml` file or separate configuration files.

. Enable the global header plugin. Ensure that the `red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-global-header` entry exists under the `plugins: list` and that `disabled` is set to `false`.

. Verify that you enabled the global header plugin.
Confirm that you listed the `red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-global-header` plugin under `plugins:` with `disabled: false` (or without a `disabled` property):
+
[source,yaml]
----
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-global-header
    disabled: false
----

. Add the required components. Under the `mountPoints` section of the plugin, add the components as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
  mountPoints:
    - mountPoint: application/header
      importName: GlobalHeader
      config:
        position: above-sidebar
    - mountPoint: global.header/component
      importName: StarredDropdown
      config:
        priority: 85
    - mountPoint: global.header/component
      importName: ApplicationLauncherDropdown
      config:
        priority: 82
    - mountPoint: global.header/component
      importName: MenuItemLink
      config:
        section: Documentation
      priority: 150
      props:
          title: {product-short}
          icon: developerHub
          link: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub
    - mountPoint: global.header/application-launcher
    importName: MenuItemLink
    config:
      section: Developer Tools
      priority: 100
      props:
          title: RHDH Local
          icon: developerHub
          link: https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-local
----

. Apply the configuration.

* Operator deployment: Update the ConfigMap and allow the Operator to reconcile the changes.
* Helm deployment: Apply your updated configuration using `helm upgrade`.

. Verify the features are enabled.
After the {product} instance restarts, confirm that the star icon and *Quicklinks* matrix appear in the global header.
