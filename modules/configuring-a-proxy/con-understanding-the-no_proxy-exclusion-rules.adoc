= Understanding the `NO_PROXY` exclusion rules

`NO_PROXY` is a comma or space-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses, with optional port numbers. If the input URL matches any of the entries listed in `NO_PROXY`, a direct request fetches that URL, for example, bypassing the proxy settings.

[NOTE]
====
The default value for `NO_PROXY` in {product-very-short} is `localhost,127.0.0.1`. If you want to override it, include at least `localhost` or `localhost:7007` in the list. Otherwise, the {product-very-short} backend might fail.

Matching follows the rules below:

* `NO_PROXY=*` will bypass the proxy for all requests.

* Space and commas might separate the entries in the `NO_PROXY` list. For example, `NO_PROXY="localhost,example.com"`, or `NO_PROXY="localhost example.com"`, or `NO_PROXY="localhost, example.com"` would have the same effect.

* If `NO_PROXY` contains no entries, configuring the `HTTP(S)_PROXY` settings makes the backend send all requests through the proxy.

* The backend does not perform a DNS lookup to determine if a request should bypass the proxy or not. For example, if DNS resolves `example.com` to `1.2.3.4`, setting `NO_PROXY=1.2.3.4` has no effect on requests sent to `example.com`. Only requests sent to the IP address `1.2.3.4` bypass the proxy.

* If you add a port after the hostname or IP address, the request must match both the host/IP and port to bypass the proxy. For example, `NO_PROXY=example.com:1234` would bypass the proxy for requests to `http(s)://example.com:1234`, but not for requests on other ports, like `http(s)://example.com`.

* If you do not specify a port after the hostname or IP address, all requests to that host/IP address will bypass the proxy regardless of the port. For example, `NO_PROXY=localhost` would bypass the proxy for requests sent to URLs like `http(s)://localhost:7077` and `http(s)://localhost:8888`.

* IP Address blocks in CIDR notation will not work. So setting `NO_PROXY=10.11.0.0/16` will not have any effect, even if the backend sends a request to an IP address in that block.

* Supports only IPv4 addresses. IPv6 addresses like `::1` will not work.

* Generally, the proxy is only bypassed if the hostname is an exact match for an entry in the `NO_PROXY` list. The only exceptions are entries that start with a dot (`.`) or with a wildcard (`*`). In such a case, bypass the proxy if the hostname ends with the entry.

[NOTE]
====
List the domain and the wildcard domain if you want to exclude a given domain and all its subdomains. For example, you would set `NO_PROXY=example.com,.example.com` to bypass the proxy for requests sent to `http(s)://example.com` and `http(s)://subdomain.example.com`.
