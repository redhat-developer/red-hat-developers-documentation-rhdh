= Viewing Software Template dependencies

As a developer, you can track which entities were created from a specific Software Template. When a platform engineer configures provenance on a template, you can quickly identify the complete dependency and impact map of that template by viewing all linked components and resources in the Catalog.

.Procedure
To view all components created from a specific template, complete the following steps:

. In the {product} navigation menu, click *Catalog*, use the filters to find and select the Software Template you wish to inspect.
. In the Software Template detail page, click the *Dependencies* tab. This view lists all catalog entities such as components, resources, and systems that reference this template, including any version information if configured.
