= Managing the added Git repositories

You can oversee and manage the Git repositories that are imported to the {product-short}.

.Prerequisites
* You have xref:proc-importing-multiple-repositories-from-github[imported GitHub repositories].


.Procedure
* Click *Bulk Import* in the left sidebar to display all the current GitHub repositories and GitLab projects that are being tracked as Import jobs, along with their status.

Added:: The Git repository is added to the {product-short} catalog after the import pull request is merged or if the Git repository already contained a `catalog-info.yaml` file during the bulk import.
Note that it may take a few minutes for the entities to be available in the catalog.

Waiting for approval:: There is an open pull request or merge request adding a `catalog-info.yaml` file to the GitHub repository or GitLab project.
You can:
* Click *pencil* icon on the right to see details about the pull request or merge request. You can use the detailed view to edit the request content right from {product-short}.
* Delete the Import job, this action closes the import pull request or merge request as well.
* To transition the Import job to the _Added_ state, merge the import pull request or merge request from the Git repository.

Empty:: {product-short} is unable to determine the import job status because the Git repository is imported from other sources but does not have a `catalog-info.yaml` file and lacks any import pull or merge request adding it.

[NOTE]
====
* After an import pull request or merge request is merged, the import status is marked as _Added_ in the list of *Added entities*, but it might take a few seconds for the corresponding entities to appear in the {product-short} Catalog.
* A location added through other sources (for example, statically in an `{my-app-config-file}` file, dynamically when {integrating-with-github-book-link}#enabling-github-repository-discovery[enabling GitHub discovery], or registered manually using the "Register an existing component" page) might show up in the Bulk Import list of Added Repositories if the following conditions are met:
** The location URL points to a `catalog-info.yaml` file at the root of the Git repository default branch.
** For GitHub only: The target repository is accessible from the configured GitHub integrations.
