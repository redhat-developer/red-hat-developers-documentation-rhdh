= Registering components manually in your {product-very-short} instance

To manually register components in your {product-very-short} instance, create a `catalog-info.yaml` file and register it with your {product} instance. The `catalog-info.yaml` file contains the metadata you wish to register for your software component.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed and configured the {product} instance.
* You have the required permissions. See {authorization-book-link}[{authorization-book-title}].

.Procedure

. In the root directory of your software project, create a file named `catalog-info.yaml`.
