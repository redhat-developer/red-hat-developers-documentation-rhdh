* Enter a keyword in the search bar to see all documents that contain the keyword anywhere in the document.
* Filter by *Owner* to see only documents that are owned by a particular user or group in your organization.
* Filter by *Tags* to see only documents that contain a particular tag.
* Filter by *Owned* to see only documents that are owned by you or by a group that you belong
* Filter by *Starred* to see only documents that you have added to favorites.

By default, the *All* field shows the total number of documents that have been imported into TechDocs. If you search or use filters, the *All* field shows the number of documents that meet the search and filter criteria that you applied.
