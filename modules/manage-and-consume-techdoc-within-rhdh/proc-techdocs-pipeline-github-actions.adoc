= Streamlining documentation builds using GitHub Actions

{product} ({product-very-short}) includes a built-in TechDocs builder, however, the default setup is not intended for production use. Deploying TechDocs documentation in a production environment involves the following actions:

* *Building the documentation in a CI/CD system*
* *Publishing the generated documentation site to external object storage*, such as AWS S3, to ensure that the generated documentation persists between restarts of {product-very-short} and can handle larger documentation workloads.
* *Configuring TechDocs in your {product-very-short} deployment to run in read-only mode* so that TechDocs reads the static generated documentation files from the cloud storage bucket without attempting to generate them at runtime.

You can implement a TechDocs pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically generate and publish your TechDocs whenever a user in your organization makes a change to a documentation file stored in your GitHub repository.

.Prerequisites

* The TechDocs plugin is enabled and configured on your {product-very-short} instance.
* Your organization has documentation files stored in a remote repository.
* You have an mkdocs.yaml file located in the root directory of your repository.
* You have the `catalog.entity.create` and `catalog.location.create` permissions to import documentation into TechDocs from a remote repository.
* You have an AWS S3 bucket to store your TechDocs sites.
* Minimal IAM Policies are configured for your S3 bucket, granting both Write and Read access.
* An administrator has created an IAM User, attached the necessary policy, and generated an access key in the AWS console.

.Procedure

. Set up the GitHub Actions workflow.
.. On GitHub, create a fork of the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider[`red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider`] repository.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `rhdh-techdocs-pipeline` repository contains a `generate-and-publish-techdocs.yaml` workflow that automatically generates TechDocs from the docs folder and publishes them to an Amazon S3 bucket.
====
+
.. Use the GitHub GUI to make sure that all of the permissions required to run the workflow are enabled.
.. Add the *Repository secrets* required to connect the workflow to your AWS account, for example, `TECHDOCS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The default `mkdocs.yaml` file in the `rhdh-techdocs-pipeline` workflow installs the `techdocs-core` and `minify` plugins.
====
.. Optional: Customize the default structure or files of the `rhdh-techdocs-pipeline` repository to meet the needs of your organization.
.. Optional: Add other `mkdocs` plugins that you want to use by adding the name of the plugins to the `plugins` section of the `mkdocs.yaml` file and to the `steps.name: install mkdocs and mkdocs plugins` section of the `generate-and-publish-techdocs.yaml` file.
. . In the navigation menu of the {ocp-short} console, click *ConfigMaps* and select your {product-very-short} `app-config.yaml` file.
. Update the `app-config.yaml` file to enable your Amazon S3 bucket to serve TechDocs to your {product-very-short} instance. For example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
techdocs:
  builder: external
  publisher:
    type: awsS3
    awsS3:
      bucketName: ${AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME}
      accountId: ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}
      region: ${AWS_REGION}

aws:
  accounts:
    - accountId: ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}
      accessKeyId: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
      secretAccessKey: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}

catalog:
     locations:
        - type: url
          target: https://github.com/_<your_org>_/rhdh-techdocs-pipeline/blob/main/catalog-info.yaml
----
. Click *Save*.
. In the navigation menu of the {ocp-short} console, click *Topology* and restart the pod.
+
[NOTE]
====
Changes to the `docs` folder or the `mkdocs.yaml` file trigger the `rhdh-techdocs-pipeline` workflow to run. After the `rhdh-techdocs-pipeline` workflow runs successfully, the generated TechDocs are uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.
====

.Verification
. Go to your {product-very-short} instance and click *Docs* to see the TechDocs served from your Amazon S3 bucket.
