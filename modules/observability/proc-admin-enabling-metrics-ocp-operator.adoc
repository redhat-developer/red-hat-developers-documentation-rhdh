= Enabling metrics monitoring in a {product} Operator installation on an {ocp-short} cluster

You can enable and view metrics for an Operator-installed {product} instance from the *Developer* perspective of the {ocp-short} web console.

.Prerequisites

* Your {ocp-short} cluster has link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/observability/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.html[monitoring for user-defined projects] enabled.
* You have installed {product} on {ocp-short} using the {product} Operator.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

Currently, the {product} Operator does not support creating a `ServiceMonitor` custom resource (CR) by default. You must complete the following steps to create a `ServiceMonitor` CR to scrape metrics from the endpoint.

. Create the `ServiceMonitor` CR as a YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: <custom_resource_name> # <1>
  namespace: <project_name> # <2>
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: <custom_resource_name>
    app.kubernetes.io/name: backstage
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - <project_name>
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      rhdh.redhat.com/app: backstage-<custom_resource_name>
  endpoints:
  - port: backend
    path: '/metrics'
----
<1> Replace `<custom_resource_name>` with the name of your {product} CR.
<2> Replace `<project_name>` with the name of the {ocp-short} project where your {product} instance is running.

. Apply the `ServiceMonitor` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc apply -f <filename>
----

.Verification

. From the *Developer* perspective in the {ocp-short} web console, select the *Observe* view.
. Click the *Metrics* tab to view metrics for {product} pods.
