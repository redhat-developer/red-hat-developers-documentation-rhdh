= Enable users to use the Topology plugin

The Topology plugin is defining additional permissions. When link:{authorization-book-url}[{authorization-book-title}] is enabled, to enable users to use the Topology plugin, grant them:

* The `kubernetes.clusters.read` and `kubernetes.resources.read`, `read` permissions to view the Topology panel.
* The `kubernetes.proxy` `use` permission to view the pod logs.
* The `catalog-entity` `read` permission to view the {product} software catalog items.

.Prerequisites
* You are link:{authorization-book-url}#managing-authorizations-by-using-external-files[managing {authorization-book-title} by using external files].

.Procedure
* Add the following permission policies to your `rbac-policy.csv` file to create a `topology-viewer` role that has access to the Topology plugin features, and add the role to the users requiring this authorization:
