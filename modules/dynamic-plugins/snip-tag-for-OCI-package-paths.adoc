The `<tag>` variable is your {product-very-short} application{apos}s version of {backstage} and the plugin version, in the format: bs_<backstage-version>_<plugin-version>. 

* To find the correct image tag for `<tag>`:
.. Look in the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.9/html/red_hat_developer_hub_release_notes/pr01[{product-very-short} release notes preface] for your {backstage} version.
.. Go to the link:https://github.com/orgs/redhat-developer/packages?tab=packages&q=[plugin packages list in the rhdh-plugin-export-overlays repository]. Search for and select your plugin.
.. Locate a compatible {backstage} version from the list of images. For example, because {product-very-short} 1.9 is based on {backstage} 1.45, you can choose any plugin tag starting with `bs_1.45`.
