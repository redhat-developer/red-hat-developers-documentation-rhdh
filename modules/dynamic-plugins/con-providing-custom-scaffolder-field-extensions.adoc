= Providing custom Scaffolder field extensions

The Scaffolder component in {product} ({product-very-short}) enables users to create software components using templates through a guided wizard. You can extend the functionality of the Scaffolder by providing custom form fields as dynamic plugins using the `scaffolderFieldExtensions` configuration.

Custom field extensions allow you to add specialized form fields that capture domain-specific data during the scaffolding process, such as environment selectors, input validations, or repository checks.

When you configure custom scaffolder field extensions:

* The dynamic plugin exposes the field extension component using `createScaffolderFieldExtension`.
* Each field extension requires a unique `importName` for registration.
* You register multiple field extensions by listing each in the configuration.

[source,yaml]

dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    my-plugin: # The plugin package name
      scaffolderFieldExtensions:
        - importName: MyNewFieldExtension # References the exported scaffolder field extension component from your plugin
----

[NOTE]
====
The `module` field is optional and specifies which set of assets to access within the plugin. By default, the system uses the `PluginRoot` module, consistent with the `scalprum.exposedModules` key in the `package.json` file of your package.
