= Search and filter the plugins

== Search by plugin name
You can use the search bar in the header to filter the Extensions plugin cards by name. For example, if you type “A” into the search bar, Extensions shows only the plugins that contain the letter “A” in the Name field.

Optionally, you can use the search bar in conjunction with a filter to filter only plugins of the selected filter by name. For example, you can apply the *Category* filter and then type a character into the search bar to view only Openshift plugins that contain the typed character in the name.

The following filters are available:

* Category
* Author
* Support type
