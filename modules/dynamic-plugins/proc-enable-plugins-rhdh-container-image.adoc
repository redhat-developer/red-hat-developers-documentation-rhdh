= Enabling plugins added in the {product-very-short} container image

In the {product-very-short} container image, a set of dynamic plugins is preloaded to enhance functionality. However, due to mandatory configuration requirements, most of the plugins are disabled.

You can enable and configure the plugins in the {product-very-short} container image, including how to manage the default configuration, set necessary environment variables, and ensure the proper functionality of the plugins within your application.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh/blob/main/dynamic-plugins.default.yaml[`dynamic-plugins.default.yaml`] file, which lists all preloaded plugins and their default configuration.
* You have deployed the {product-very-short} application, and have access to the logs of the `install-dynamic-plugins` init container.
* You have the necessary permissions to modify plugin configurations and access the application environment.
* You have identified and set the required environment variables referenced by the plugin's default configuration. These environment variables must be defined in the Helm Chart or Operator configuration.

.Procedure
. Start your {product-very-short} application and access the logs of the `install-dynamic-plugins` init container within the {product-very-short} pod.
. Identify the {dynamic-plugins-reference-book-link}#red-hat-supported-plugins[Red Hat supported plugins] that are disabled by default.
. Copy the package configuration from the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh/blob/main/dynamic-plugins.default.yaml[`dynamic-plugins.default.yaml`] file.
. Open the plugin configuration file and locate the plugin entry you want to enable.
+
The location of the plugin configuration file varies based on the deployment method. For more details, see {installing-and-viewing-plugins-book-link}[{installing-and-viewing-plugins-book-title}].
. Modify the `disabled` field to `false` and add the package name as follows:
