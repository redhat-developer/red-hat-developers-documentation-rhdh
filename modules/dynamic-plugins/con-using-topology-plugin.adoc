. Go to the TOPOLOGY tab and you can view the workloads such as deployments or pods as nodes.

. Select a node and a pop-up appears on the right side, which contains two tabs: Details and Resources.


. The Details and Resources tabs contain the associated information and resources of the node.

. Click on the Open URL button on the top of a node.

When you click on the open URL button, it allows you to access the associated Ingresses and runs your application in a new tab.
