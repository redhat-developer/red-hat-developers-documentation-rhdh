= Using the Topology plugin

Topology is a front-end plugin that enables you to view the workloads as nodes that power any service on the Kubernetes cluster.

== Enabling users to use the Topology plugin

The Topology plugin is defining additional permissions. When link:{authorization-book-url}[{autorization-book-title}] is enabled, to enable users to use the Topology plugin, grant them:

* The `topology.view.read` `read` permission to view the Topology panel.
* The `kubernetes.proxy` `use` permission to view the pod logs.
* The `catalog-entity` `read` permission to view the {product} software catalog items.

.Prerequisites
* You are link:{authorization-book-url}#managing-authorizations-by-using-external-files[managing {autorization-book-title} by using external files].

.Procedure
* Add the following permission policies to your `rbac-policy.csv` file to create a `topology-viewer` role that has access to the Topology plugin features, and add the role to the users requiring this authorization:
