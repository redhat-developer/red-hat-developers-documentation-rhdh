Before creating or converting plugins for {product} ({product-very-short}), you must establish a specific local development toolchain. This toolchain allows you to write standard Backstage code, convert it into a dynamic format, and package it for deployment without rebuilding the core RHDH platform.

== Required skills and languages
To develop dynamic plugins, you should possess the following technical proficiencies:

JavaScript and TypeScript:: The core languages used for Backstage frontend and backend development.
React:: Required for building frontend plugin components.
Node.js ecosystem:: Familiarity with package management (NPM/Yarn) and module handling.

== The development toolchain
The following tools are essential for initializing, building, and packaging your plugins:

Node.js (via NVM):: Node.js is the engine that runs JavaScript on your computer.
+
Backstage requires specific Active LTS (Long Term Support) versions (v18 or v20) to function correctly. Using Node Version Manager (NVM) allows you to switch between these versions easily, ensuring compatibility with the RHDH backend system.

Yarn (Classic):: Yarn is a package manager that handles all the libraries (dependencies) that your application needs.
+
The Backstage project structure is optimized for Yarn (specifically Yarn Classic 1.x) to manage workspaces and dependencies efficiently.

Containerization tools (Docker or Podman):: These tools used to run containers and package applications.
+  
* Packaging: Dynamic plugins are recommended to be distributed as OCI images. You use Docker or Podman to package your derived plugin assets into an image that can be pushed to a registry, for example, Quay.io and sideloaded into {product-very-short}.  
+
* TechDocs: Docker is used locally to run containers that generate technical documentation.

{product-very-short} plugin tools::
These specialized tools facilitate the conversion of standard plugins into the dynamic architecture required by {product-very-short}.
+
* {product-very-short} Plugin Factory and {product-very-short}-cli: These tools assist in initializing new plugins or converting existing standard Backstage plugins into the {product-very-short} dynamic plugin format. They help structure the code to support dynamic loading.
+
* Janus IDP CLI (@janus-idp/cli): This command-line tool is critical for the export process. It allows you to run commands like export-dynamic-plugin, which repackages your code into a derived package containing the necessary configuration (like Scalprum for frontend) and dependency handling (bundling private dependencies vs. sharing platform dependencies)



//  Overview of content required: This module will detail the technical prerequisites for dynamic plugin development, including required languages, skills, and tools.

//  ===========


// Understand the technical prerequisites for dynamic plugin development, including required languages, skills, and tools such as Node.js, NPM, Yarn, RHDH Plugin Factory, and rhdh-cli.

// =============

// 1. Install Node.js (via NVM)
// What it is: Node.js is the engine that runs JavaScript on your computer.
// Why NVM: Node Version Manager (NVM) lets you switch between versions easily, as Backstage requires specific LTS (Long Term Support) versions (v18 or v20).
// How to install:
// macOS/Linux: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
// Windows: Download nvm-windows.
// Command: nvm install 20 && nvm use 20
// 2. Install Yarn (Classic)
// What it is: A package manager that handles all the libraries (dependencies) your app needs. Backstage is optimized for Yarn.
// How to install: npm install --global yarn
// 3. Install Docker
// What it is: Used by Backstage to run "containers" for tech documentation (TechDocs) or to package your app for production.
// How to install: Download Docker Desktop.
