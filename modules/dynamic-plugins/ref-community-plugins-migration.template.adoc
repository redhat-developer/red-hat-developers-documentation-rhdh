= Community plugins migration to the GitHub Container Registry

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Breaking Change in RHDH 1.9*

Starting with {product} 1.9, community-supported plugins are no longer distributed as bundled wrappers in the {product-short} container image. These plugins are now built using GitHub Actions and published exclusively to the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io).

If you use the plugins listed in this section, you must update your dynamic plugins configuration (in `dynamic-plugins-default.yaml`, your ConfigMap or CustomResource) to use the new `oci://ghcr.io/...` paths.
====

== What changed

In {product-short} 1.8 and earlier, community plugins were:

* Wrapped and bundled in the {product-short} container image.
* Referenced by using local paths, such as `./dynamic-plugins/dist/<plugin-name>`.

Starting with {product-short} 1.9, community plugins are:

* Built using GitHub Actions from the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays[rhdh-plugin-export-overlays] repository.
* Published to `ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays`.
* Referenced by using OCI registry paths, such as `oci://ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/<plugin-name>:<tag>`.

[TIP]
====
To ensure environment stability, use a SHA256 digest instead of a version tag.
====

== Migration steps

To migrate your configuration:

. Identify plugins in your ConfigMap or CustomResource that use local paths starting with `./dynamic-plugins/dist/`.
. Find the corresponding `ghcr.io` path in the following migration table:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# Before (RHDH 1.8 and earlier)
plugins:
  - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-jenkins
    disabled: false

# After (RHDH 1.9+)
plugins:
  - package: oci://ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/backstage-community-plugin-jenkins:bs_1.45.3__0.26.0
    disabled: false
----

. Update your configuration to use the new OCI registry path.


== Understanding the tag format

The `ghcr.io` image tags use the following format: `bs_<backstage-version>__<plugin-version>`

Example: `bs_1.45.3__0.26.0`:
where
* `bs_1.45.3`: Built against {backstage} version 1.45.3
* `0.26.0`: Nodejs-packaged {backstage} plugin, version 0.26.0

== Community plugins migration table

The following table lists all %%MIGRATION_COUNT%% community-supported plugins that have been migrated from bundled wrappers to `ghcr.io`.

[NOTE]
====
Replace `<tag>` with the version tag corresponding to your {product-short} version. For the latest tags, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays[rhdh-plugin-export-overlays repository].
====

[TIP]
====
To ensure environment stability, use a SHA256 digest instead of a version tag.
====

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
|Plugin Name
|Old Path (RHDH 1.8)
|New Path (RHDH 1.9+)

%%MIGRATION_TABLE%%

== Plugins remaining bundled in RHDH 1.9

The following plugins remain bundled in 1.9 while transitioning to `ghcr.io` distribution in a future release:

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
|Plugin Name
|Old Path (RHDH 1.9)
|New Path (RHDH 1.10+)

%%BUNDLED_PLUGINS%%
|===

== Troubleshooting

=== Plugin not loading after migration

If a plugin fails to load, perform the following checks:

. Verify the `ghcr.io` path is correct and the image tag or digest exists.
. Confirm your cluster has network access to `ghcr.io`.
. Review {product-short} logs for OCI pull errors.

[TIP]
====
To avoid unexpected updates, use a SHA256 digest instead of a tag.
====

=== Finding available tags

To list available image tags for a plugin, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
# Using skopeo (filter for bs_ tags only, excluding pr_ and next__ tags)
skopeo list-tags docker://ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/<plugin-name> | jq -r '.Tags[]' | grep '^bs_'
----
