//= Using a custom NPM registry for dynamic plugin packages
= Installing dynamic plugins in an air-gapped environment

You can install external plugins in an air-gapped environment by setting up a custom NPM registry.

You can configure the NPM registry URL and authentication information for dynamic plugin packages using a Helm chart. For dynamic plugin packages obtained through `npm pack`, you can use a `.npmrc` file. 

Using the Helm chart, add the `.npmrc` file to the NPM registry by creating a secret named `dynamic-plugins-npmrc` with the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: dynamic-plugins-npmrc
type: Opaque
stringData:
  .npmrc: |
    registry=<registry-url>
    //<registry-url>:_authToken=<auth-token>
          ...
