= Navigating the plugin marketplace and filtering plugins using badges

The plugin marketplace now includes new indicators that enhance transparency. These changes provide clearer information about the status of each plugin, support level, and other relevant details, allowing you to make informed decisions when you select plugins. By understanding these visual cues and descriptive texts, you can quickly identify the maturity, support, and origin of each plugin.

The marketplace employs the following badges and tags to provide quick visual cues:

* *Certified*
* *Generally Available* (*GA*)
* *Community Plugin*
* *Tech Preview*
* *Dev Preview*
* *Custom Plugin*
+
[NOTE]
====
Hovering your mouse cursor over any badge or tag (such as *GA* or *Certified*) on either the plugin list or details page displays a helper text explanation clarifying its meaning and implications. Hovering over tags such as *tech preview*, or *dev preview* will display a helper text indicating if it is in a technical preview phase, or a development preview phase.
====

The plugin details pages include several fields such as `author`, `tags`, `category`,`publisher`, and `support provider`, which provide more context. Additionally, the update changes the `version` text to `{product-custom-resource-type} compatibility version` to offer more precise information regarding compatibility.

The following is a list of the filtering examples:

* To view only plugins that are *Generally Available* (*GA*), apply the `GA` filter. (There are currently 27 plugins with this badge).

* To find *Certified* plugins, apply the `Certified` filter. For these plugins, helper text is available both on the main plugin list page and on the individual plugin details page, explaining what certification entails.

* To explore plugins currently in *Tech Preview* (44 plugins), *Dev Preview* (1 plugin), or *Community Plugin* status (1 plugin), apply the corresponding filter.
