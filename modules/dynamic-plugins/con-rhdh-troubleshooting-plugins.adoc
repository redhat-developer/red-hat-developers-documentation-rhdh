= Mandatory environment variables
Some dynamic plugins require environment variables to be set. If a mandatory environment variable is not set, and the plugin is enabled, then the application might fail at startup.

The mandatory environment variables for each plugin are listed in the Dynamic plugins support matrix.

= Zib-bomb detection
Zib-bomb detection When installing some dynamic plugin containing large files, if the installation script considers the package archive to be a Zib-Bomb, the installation fails.

To increase the maximum permitted size of a file inside a package archive, you can increase the `MAX_ENTRY_SIZE` environment value of the deployment `install-dynamic-plugins initContainer` from the default size of `20000000` bytes.
