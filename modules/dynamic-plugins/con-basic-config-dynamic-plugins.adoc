= Basic configuration of dynamic plugins

Some dynamic plugins require environment variables to be set. If a mandatory environment variable is not set, and the plugin is enabled, then the application might fail at startup.

//The mandatory environment variables for each plugin are listed in the xref:rhdh-supported-plugins[Dynamic plugins support matrix]. 

[NOTE]
====
Zib-bomb detection 
When installing some dynamic plugin containing large files, if the installation script considers the package archive to be a Zib-Bomb, the installation fails.

To increase the maximum permitted size of a file inside a package archive, you can increase the  `MAX_ENTRY_SIZE` environment value of the deployment `install-dynamic-plugins initContainer` from the default size of `20000000` bytes.
