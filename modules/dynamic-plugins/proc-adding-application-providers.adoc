= Adding application providers

You can add application providers using the `application/provider` mount point. You can use a mount point to configure a context provider as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
# app-config.yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    my-plugin: # The plugin package name
      dynamicRoutes:
        - path: /<route>
          importName: Component # The component to load on the route
      mountPoints:
        - mountPoint: application/provider
          importName: <exported provider component>
----

[NOTE]
====
. You can configure multiple application providers by adding entries to the `mountPoints` field.
. The `package_name` key under `dynamicPlugins.frontend` **must match** the `scalprum.name` value in the `package.json` file of your plugin. This ensures your dynamic plugin loads correctly at runtime.
