= Adding application providers

You can add application providers using the `application/provider` mount point. You can use a mount point to configure a context provider as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
# app-config.yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  frontend:
    <package_name>: # plugin_package_name same as `scalprum.name` key in plugin's `package.json`
      dynamicRoutes:
        - path: /<route>
          importName: Component # Component you want to load on the route
      mountPoints:
        - mountPoint: application/provider
          importName: <exported provider component>
----

[NOTE]
====
You can configure multiple application providers by adding entries to the `mountPoints` field.
