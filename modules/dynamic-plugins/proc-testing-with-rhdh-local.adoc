= Verify plugins locally
{product-very-short} Local enables you to test a dynamic plugin that you have built *before* publishing it to a registry.

//== Load dynamic plugins from a local directory
During boot, the install-dynamic-plugins container reads the contents of the plugin configuration file and activates, configures, or downloads any plugins listed. {product-very-short} Local supports two ways of specifying dynamic plugin configuration:

* Default path: `configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.yaml`

* User override path: `configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml`


The `dynamic-plugins.override.yaml` configuration takes precedence over the `dynamic-plugins.yaml` configuration. You should not modify the default `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file, use the `dynamic-plugins.override.yaml` to override the default file settings.

In addition, the local-plugins directory is mounted into the install-dynamic-plugins container at `/opt/app-root/src/local-plugins`. Any plugins placed there can be activated or configured the same way without downloading.

.Prerequisites
* You have exported a custom plugin by using the `npx @red-hat-developer-hub/cli@latest plugin export` command that has generated a `dist-dynamic` directory containing the following:

** dist-scalprum: A directory that contains the Webpack federated modules.
** package.json: A modified version of your `package.json` file optimized for dynamic loading.

.Procedure
. Copy the `dist-dynamic` directory directly into the `local-plugins` folder, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
--
# Copy the dynamic distribution to RHDH Local
$ cp -r dist-dynamic/ <RHDH_LOCAL_PATH>/local-plugins/example-plugin
--
+
[NOTE]
====
The `local-plugins/simple-example/` directory in your {product-very-short} Local installation should contain the plugin files from `dist-dynamic` directory, including the `dist-scalprum` directory and the `package.json` file
====
. Ensure that permissions allow the container to read the files.
. Configure your plugin in the `configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml` file.
