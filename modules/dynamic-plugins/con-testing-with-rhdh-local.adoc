= Verify plugins locally
{product-very-short} Local excels at supporting local plugin development, enabling you to build, test, and iterate on dynamic plugins *before* publishing them to a registry. This guide covers the complete development workflow from scaffolding to testing.

== Load dynamic plugins from a local directory
During boot, the install-dynamic-plugins container reads the contents of the plugin configuration file and activates, configures, or downloads any plugins listed. RHDH Local supports two ways of specifying dynamic plugin configuration:

. Default path: configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.yaml

. User override path: configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml or configs/dynamic-plugins.yaml. If present, this file will automatically override the default and be used by the install-dynamic-plugins container. configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml takes precedence over configs/dynamic-plugins.yaml.

In addition, the local-plugins directory is mounted into the install-dynamic-plugins container at /opt/app-root/src/local-plugins. Any plugins placed there can be activated/configured the same way (without downloading).

To load dynamic plugins from your local machine:

. Copy the dynamic plugin binary file into the local-plugins directory.
. Make sure permissions allow the container to read the files (e.g. chmod -R 777 local-plugins for quick testing).
. Configure your plugin in one of the supported config files:
.. Prefer configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml for local user overrides.
.. If no override file is present, configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.yaml will be used.
