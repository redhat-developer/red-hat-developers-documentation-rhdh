= Linking to the source code editor or the source

Add the following annotations to workload resources, such as Deployments to navigate to the Git repository of the associated application using the source code editor:

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  app.openshift.io/vcs-uri: <GIT_REPO_URL>
----

Add the following annotation to navigate to a specific branch:

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  app.openshift.io/vcs-ref: <GIT_REPO_BRANCH>
----

[NOTE]
====
If Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is installed and configured and git URL annotations are also added to the workload YAML file, then clicking on the edit code decorator redirects you to the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance.

[NOTE]
====
When you deploy your application using the OCP Git import flows, then you do not need to add the labels as import flows do that. Otherwise, you need to add the labels manually to the workload YAML file.
====

//The labels are not similar to `backstage.io/edit-url` annotations as it points to the catalog entity metadata source file and is applied to RHDH catalog entity metadata YAML file, but not Kubernetes resources.

You can also add the `app.openshift.io/edit-url` annotation with the edit URL that you want to access using the decorator.
