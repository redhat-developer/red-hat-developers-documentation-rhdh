= Installing plugins from OCI plugins by using per-registry TLS configuration

.Procedure

. Create a ConfigMap from the CA certificate in the namespace where you are deploying your {product-very-short} instance:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc create configmap registry-ca-crt --from-file=ca.crt
----

. Mount the CA certificate ConfigMap into your {product-very-short} configuration:
.. For a Helm chart installation, update your Helm chart configuration file, as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
upstream:
  backstage:
    extraVolumes:
      # IMPORTANT: Due to a Helm limitation with arrays, you must also
      # include all the volumes defined in the default Helm Chart
      # before adding the new one
      # ...
      - name: registry-ca-crt
        configMap:
          name: registry-ca-crt

    initContainers:
      - name: install-dynamic-plugins
        # IMPORTANT: Due to a Helm limitation with arrays, you must also
        # include all the other fields defined in the default Helm Chart
        # ...

        volumeMounts:
          # IMPORTANT: Due to a Helm limitation with arrays, you must also
          # include all the volume mounts defined in the default Helm Chart
          # before adding the new one
          # ...
          - name: registry-ca-crt
            # Hostname and port must match your target registry
            mountPath: '/etc/containers/certs.d/reg.example.com:5000'
----

.. For Operator-based installations, update your Backstage Custom Resource (CR), as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  application:
    extraFiles:
      configMaps:
        - name: registry-ca-crt
          # Hostname and port must match your target registry
          mountPath: '/etc/containers/certs.d/reg.example.com:5000'
          containers:
            - install-dynamic-plugins
