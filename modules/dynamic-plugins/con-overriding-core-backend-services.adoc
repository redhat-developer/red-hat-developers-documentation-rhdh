= Overriding Core Backend Service Configuration

The {product} ({product-very-short}) backend platform consists of a number of core services that are well encapsulated. The {product-very-short} backend installs these default core services statically during initialization. 

You can configure these core services by customizing the backend source code and rebuilding your {product-short} application. Alternatively, you can customize a core service by installing it as a `BackendFeature` by using dynamic plugin functionality.

To use the dynamic plugin functionality to customize a core service in your RHDH application, you must configure the backend to avoid statically installing a given default core service.

For example, adding a middleware function to handle all incoming requests can be done by installing a custom `configure` function for the root `HTTP` router backend service which allows access to the underlying Express application.

.Example of a `BackendFeature` middleware function to handle incoming `HTTP` requests

[source,javascript]
----
// Create the BackendFeature
export const customRootHttpServerFactory: BackendFeature =
  rootHttpRouterServiceFactory({
    configure: ({ app, routes, middleware, logger }) => {
      logger.info(
        'Using custom root HttpRouterServiceFactory configure function',
      );
      app.use(middleware.helmet());
      app.use(middleware.cors());
      app.use(middleware.compression());
      app.use(middleware.logging());
      // Add a the custom middleware function before all
      // of the route handlers
      app.use(addTestHeaderMiddleware({ logger }));
      app.use(routes);
      app.use(middleware.notFound());
      app.use(middleware.error());
    },
  });

// Export the BackendFeature as the default entrypoint
export default customRootHttpServerFactory;
----

In the above example, as the `BackendFeature` overrides the default implementation of the HTTP router service, you must set the `ENABLE_CORE_ROOTHTTPROUTER_OVERRIDE` environment variable to `true` so that the {product-short} does not install the default implementation automatically.

== Overriding environment variables
To allow a dynamic plugin to load a core service override, you must start the {product-short} backend with the corresponding core service ID environment variable set to `true`.
