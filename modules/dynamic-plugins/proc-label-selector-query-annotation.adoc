= Label selector query annotation

You can write your own custom label, which {product-very-short} uses to find the Kubernetes resources. The label selector takes precedence over the ID annotations:

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector: 'app=my-app,component=front-end'
----

If you have multiple entities while Red Hat Dev Spaces is configured and want multiple entities to support the edit code decorator that redirects to the Red Hat Dev Spaces instance, you can add the backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector annotation to the catalog-info.yaml file for each entity.

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector: 'component in (<BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME>,che)'
----

If you are using the previous label selector, you must add the following labels to your resources so that the Kubernetes plugin gets the Kubernetes resources from the requested entity:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  component: che # add this label to your che cluster instance
labels:
  component: <BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME> # add this label to the other resources associated with your entity
----

You can also write your own custom query for the label selector with unique labels to differentiate your entities. However, you need to ensure that you add those labels to the resources associated with your entities including your CheCluster instance.
