= Installing a plugin by using Extensions
You can install a plugin and configure it by updating the `{my-app-config-file}` file by using *Extensions*.

== Prerequisites
* You have the necessary permissions to modify plugin configurations and access the application environment.
* You have identified and set the required environment variables referenced by the plugin's default configuration. These environment variables must be defined in the Helm Chart or Operator configuration.

.Procedure
. Use the search bar in the header to search for the plugin that you wish to install and click on the card. For example, search for Tekton and click *Read more* on the *Pipelines With Tekton* card.

[NOTE]
In {product-very-short} 1.6, the *Install* button is disabled, so you must copy the plugin configuration to the `{my-app-config-file}` file.
. In the `{my-app-config-file}` file, add the plugin configuration that you copied in the previous step to the `plugins` definitions.

.Verification
. Click *Administration* > *Extensions*.
. Go to the *Installed* tab to view a list of installed plugins.
. Search for the plugin that you installed to confirm that it is available and enabled.

////
