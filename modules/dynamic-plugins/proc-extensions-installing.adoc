= Installing a plugin by using Extensions
You can install a plugin and configure it by updating the `{my-app-config-file}` file by using *Extensions*.

== Prerequisites
* You have the necessary permissions to modify plugin configurations and access the application environment.
* You have identified and set the required environment variables referenced by the plugin's default configuration. These environment variables must be defined in the Helm Chart or Operator configuration.

.Procedure
. Open your {product-short} application and click *Administration* > *Extensions*.
. Use the search bar on the *Extensions* page to find the plugin you wish to install, then click on the card. For example, search for Tekton and click *Read more* on the *Pipelines With Tekton* card.

. Click the *About the plugin* tab to view installation and configuration details for the plugin.
. Click the *Examples* tab to display the default plugin configuration.
. Click *Apply* to copy the default plugin configuration to the YAML editor.
. In the YAML editor, click the copy icon to copy the plugin configuration.

+
[NOTE]
In {product-very-short} 1.6, the *Install* button is disabled, so you must copy the plugin configuration to the `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file.
. In the `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file, add the plugin configuration that you copied in the previous step to the `plugins` definitions.
+
[NOTE]
If you have installed {product-very-short} by using the Helm Chart, to enable the plugin, you may need to roll out your {product-very-short} project manually.

.Verification
. Click *Administration* > *Extensions*.
. Go to the *Installed* tab to view a list of installed plugins.
. Search for the plugin that you installed to confirm that it is available and enabled.

////
. To disable the the Extensions feature plugins, edit your `dynamic-plugins.yaml` with the following content.
