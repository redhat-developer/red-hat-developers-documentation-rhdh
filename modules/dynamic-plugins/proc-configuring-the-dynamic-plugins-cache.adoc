= Configuring the dynamic plugins cache

.Procedure
* To configure the dynamic plugins cache, set the following optional dynamic plugin cache parameters in your `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file:

`pullPolicy: IfNotPresent` (default)::
Download the artifact if it is not already present in the dynamic-plugins-root folder, without checking image digests.

`pullPolicy: Always`::
Compare the image digest in the remote registry and downloads the artifact if it has changed, even if {product-short} has already downloaded the plugin before.
+
When applied to the Node Package Manager (NPM) downloading method, download the remote artifact without a digest check.
+
Example `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file configuration to download the remote artifact without a digest check:
+
[source,yaml]
----
plugins:
  - disabled: false
    pullPolicy: Always
    package: 'oci://quay.io/example-org/example-plugin:v1.0.0!internal-backstage-plugin-example'
----

`forceDownload: false` (default)::
Older option to download the artifact if it is not already present in the dynamic-plugins-root folder, without checking image digests.

`forceDownload: true`::
Older option to force a reinstall of the plugin, bypassing the cache.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `pullPolicy` option takes precedence over the `forceDownload` option.

The `forceDownload` option might become deprecated in a future {product-short} release.
