= Using the dynamic plugins cache

The dynamic plugins cache in {product} ({product-very-short}) enhances the installation process and reduces platform boot time by storing previously installed plugins. If the configuration remains unchanged, this feature prevents the need to re-download plugins on subsequent boots.

When you enable dynamic plugins cache:

* The system calculates a checksum of each plugin's YAML configuration (excluding `pluginConfig`).
* The checksum is stored in a file named `dynamic-plugin-config.hash` within the plugin's directory.
* During boot, if a plugin's package reference matches the previous installation and the checksum is unchanged, the download is skipped.
* Plugins that are disabled since the previous boot are automatically removed.

[NOTE]
To enable the dynamic plugins cache in {product-very-short}, the plugins directory `dynamic-plugins-root` must be a persistent volume.
