= Enabling floating action button localization in {product-very-short}

You can enable translation key support for floating action buttons, so that users can onboard in their preferred language. In {product-short}, all existing and newly created floating action buttons support localization using dedicated translation keys. 

The Global Floating Action Button plugin supports internationalization (i18n) through translation keys. You can use `labelKey` and `toolTipKey` properties to provide translation keys instead of static text.

== Built-in translation keys
The plugin provides built-in translation keys organized under the `fab` namespace:

* `fab.create.label` - "Create"
* `fab.create.tooltip` - "Create entity"
* `fab.docs.label` - "Docs"
* `fab.docs.tooltip` - "Documentation"
* `fab.apis.label` - "APIs"
* `fab.apis.tooltip` - "API Documentation"
* `fab.github.label` - "GitHub"
* `fab.github.tooltip` - "GitHub Repository"
* `fab.bulkImport.label` - "Bulk Import"
* `fab.bulkImport.tooltip` - "Register multiple repositories in bulk"
* `fab.quay.label` - "Quay"
* `fab.quay.tooltip` - "Quay Container Registry"

== Supported languages
The plugin includes translations for:

* English (default)
// * German (de)
* French (fr)
// * Spanish (es)

== Ensuring backward compatibility when providing translation support
To ensure backward compatibility while providing translation support when available, the following order is used to resolve string translations:

. If the `labelKey` is provided, the plugin will attempt to resolve the translation key
. If the translation key is found, it will be used as the label
. If the translation key is not found, the plugin will fall back to the label property

[NOTE]
The same logic applies to `toolTipKey` and `toolTip`.

== Internal translation implementation
The plugin uses a centralized translation system where:

* The `useTranslation()` hook is called in components that render floating action buttons to ensure proper translation context initialization
* The translation function (`t`) is passed down to child components that need to resolve translation keys
* This internal architecture prevents infinite re-render loops and ensures stable component rendering
* All components that use `CustomFab` must provide the translation function as a prop

[NOTE]
When extending or modifying the plugin components, ensure that the `useTranslation()` hook is called in parent components and the `t` prop is passed to `CustomFab` instances to maintain proper translation functionality and prevent rendering issues.
