= Multiple resources

You can define and create multiple resources of the same type in a single YAML file. This is applicable to any resource type that is a `list` in the resource table. To define multiple resources, use the `---` delimiter to separate each resource definition.

For example, adding the following code snip to `pvcs.yaml` creates two PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) called `backstage-{cr-name}-myclaim1` and `backstage-{cr-name}-myclaim2` and mounts them to the {product-custom-resource-type} container accordingly.
