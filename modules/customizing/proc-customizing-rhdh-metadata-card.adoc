= Customizing the {product-very-short} Metadata card on the Settings page

The *Settings* page in {product} contains a *{product-very-short} Metadata* card. By default, the *{product-very-short} Metadata* card shows the *{product-very-short} Version* and *Backstage Version* of your {product} instance. When you click the *Show more* icon, the card expands to also show *Upstream*, *Midstream*, and *Build Time* information.

You can override the default to show custom build information about your {product} instance in the card. You can customize the card title as well as the card contents.

.Procedure

To customize the *{product-very-short} Metadata* card, complete the following step:

* In your app-config.yaml file, configure the `buildinfo` field. For example:
+
[source,yaml,subs=+attributes,+quotes]
----
buildInfo:
  title: _<metadata_card_title>_
  card:
    TechDocs builder: '_<techdocs_builder>_'
    Authentication provider: '_<authentication_provider>_'
    RBAC: disabled
  full: true

----
+
where

_<metadata_card_title>_ :: Specifies the title that you want to display on the customized card.
_<techdocs_builder>_ :: Specifies whether to generate and publish the docs or to only fetch the docs when using the default build strategy. Possible values are `local` or `external`. If you want to generate and publish the docs, set the `techdocs.builder` field to `local` in your app-config.yaml file. If you only want to fetch the docs without generating and publishing them, set the `techdocs.builder` field to `external`.
_<authentication_provider>_ :: Specifies the authentication provider that you want to use. Example values are `GitHub` or `GitLab`.
`full` :: Specifies what information is shown on the customized card. Possible values are `true` or `false`. If set to `true`, only the information specified in this configuration is shown on the card. If set to `false`, the specified information is shown on the card along with the build versions. The default value is `true`.

.Result
The *Settings* page displays a card with a custom title and custom build information about your {product} instance.
