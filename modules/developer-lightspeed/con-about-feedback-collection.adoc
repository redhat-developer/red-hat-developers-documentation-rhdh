= About feedback collection

{ls-short} collects feedback from users who engage with the feedback feature in the virtual assistant interface. If a user submits feedback, the feedback score (thumbs up or down), text feedback (if entered), the user query, and the LLM provider response are stored and stored locally in the cluster. {company-name} does not have access to the collected feedback data.
