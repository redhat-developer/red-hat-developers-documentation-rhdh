= About feedback collection

{ls-short} collects feedback from users who engage with the feedback feature in the virtual assistant interface. If a user submits feedback, the feedback score (thumbs up or down), text feedback (if entered), the user query, and the LLM provider response are stored locally in the file system of the Pod. {company-name} does not have access to the collected feedback data.
