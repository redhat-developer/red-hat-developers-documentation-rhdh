This early access program enables customers to share feedback on the user experience, features, capabilities, and any issues encountered. Your input helps ensure that {ls-short} better meets your needs when it is officially released and made generally available.

{ls-short} provides a natural language interface within the {product-very-short} console, helping you easily find information about the product, understand its features, and get answers to your questions.

You can experience {ls-short} Developer Preview by installing the Developer Lightspeed for {product} plugin within an existing {product-very-short} instance.
Alternatively, if you prefer to test it locally first, you can try {ls-short} using {product-local-very-short}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ls-short} uses a FAB instead of a sidebar navigation item. If your environment uses another global FAB, you must move the existing button or disable it to prevent interface elements from overlapping. In your dynamic plugin configuration file, make the following update:
