= Supported architecture for {ls-brand-name}

{ls-short} is available as a plugin on all platforms that host {product-very-short}. It requires the use of {lcs-name}, which runs as a sidecar container. {lcs-short} acts as the intermediary layer for interfacing with Large Language Model (LLM) providers.

{ls-short} handles functionalities like question validation, feedback, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by leveraging components often built with Llama Stack.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, the provided {lcs-short} image is built for x86 platforms. To use other platforms (for example, arm64), you must ensure that you enable emulation.
