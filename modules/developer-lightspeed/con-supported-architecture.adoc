= Supported architecture for {ls-brand-name}

{ls-short} is available as a plugin on all platforms that host {product-very-short}. It requires two sidecar containers: the {lcs-name} and the Llama Stack service.

The {lcs-short} container acts as the intermediary layer, which interfaces with and manages the Llama Stack service.
