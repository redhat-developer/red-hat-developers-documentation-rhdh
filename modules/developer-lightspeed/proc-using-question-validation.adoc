= Using Question Validation in {ls-short}

{ls-short} utilizes *Question Validation* to validate the query to check if it relates to {product}.

When a user asks a question that falls outside of these restricted topics, {ls-short} provides a general response to notify the user that the question is out of scope.
If you want to disable the *Question Validation* feature to allow for broader questioning, you can set `questionValidation` to `false` in your {ls-short} app config file.

.Procedure

* To disable the *Question Validation* feature, in your {ls-short} `{my-app-config-file}` file, add the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
lightspeed:
  # ... other lightspeed configurations
  questionValidation: false
----
