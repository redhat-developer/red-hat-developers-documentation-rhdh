= About {rcs-name}

The {rcs-name} ({rcs-short}) acts as an intermediary and service layer for interfacing with LLM providers. {rcs-short} handles LLM provider setup, authentication, and includes functionalities such as question validation, feedback, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The {ls-short} plugin within {product-very-short} communicates with the {rcs-short} sidecar to send prompts and receives responses from the configured LLM service. The {rcs-short} sidecar is used to centralize the LLM interaction logic and configuration alongside your {product-very-short} instance.

[NOTE]
====
{ls-brand-name} is a Developer Preview release. You must manually deploy the {rcs-name} as a sidecar container, and then install the {ls-short} plugin on your {product-very-short} instance.
