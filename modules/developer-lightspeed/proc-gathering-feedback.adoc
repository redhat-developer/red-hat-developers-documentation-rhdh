= Gathering feedback in {ls-short}

Feedback collection is an optional feature configured on the {lcs-short}. This feature gathers user feedback by providing thumbs-up/down ratings and text comments directly from the chat window. 

{lcs-short} collects the feedback, the user's query, and the response of the model, storing the data as a JSON file on the local file system of the Pod. A platform administrator must later collect and analyze this data to assess model performance and improve the user experience.

The collected data resides in the cluster where {product-very-short} and {lcs-short} are deployed, making it accessible only to platform administrators for that cluster. For data removal, users must request this action from their platform administrator, as {company-name} neither collects nor accesses this data.

.Procedure

. To enable or disable feedback collection, in the {lcs-short} configuration file (`lightspeed-stack.yaml`), add the following settings:
