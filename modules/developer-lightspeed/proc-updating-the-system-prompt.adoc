[id="proc-updating-the-system-prompt_{context}"]
= Updating the system prompt in {ls-short}

You can override the default system prompt that {ls-short} uses to better frame queries to your LLM. Customizing the system prompt allows you to refine the context, personality, and instructions that the LLM receives, improving the relevance and accuracy of the responses it creates for your specific environment.

.Procedure

* To set a custom system prompt, in your {ls-short} app config file, add or modify the `lightspeed.systemPrompt` key and set its value to your preferred prompt string as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
lightspeed:
  # ... other lightspeed configurations
  systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant focused on {product} development."
----

Set `systemPrompt` to prefix all queries sent by {ls-short} to the LLM with this instruction, guiding the model to generate more tailored responses.
