link:https://ollama.com[Ollama] is a powerful and easy-to-use open-source project that simplifies the process of running large language models (LLMs) locally on your computer. It provides a simple command-line interface for downloading, managing, and running a wide variety of open-source models, such as Llama 3, Mistral, and many others, all without requiring a dedicated server or cloud service. By abstracting away the complex setup and dependencies, Ollama makes it incredibly accessible for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to experiment with, build on, and integrate state-of-the-art LLMs into their own applications directly from their personal machines.

The open source Ollama server link:https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama[in container form] provides a convenient local testbed for LLM models that is very accessible and easily controlled.
