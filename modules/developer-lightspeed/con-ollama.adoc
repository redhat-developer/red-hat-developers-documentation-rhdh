link:https://ollama.com[Ollama] is a powerful and easy-to-use open-source project that simplifies the process of running large language models (LLMs) locally on your computer. It provides a simple command-line interface for downloading, managing, and running a wide variety of open-source models, such as Llama 3, Mistral, and many others, all without requiring a dedicated server or cloud service. By abstracting away the complex setup and dependencies, Ollama makes it accessible for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to experiment with, build on, and integrate state-of-the-art LLMs into their applications directly from their personal machines.

The open source Ollama server link:https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama[in container form] provides a convenient local testbed for LLM models that is very accessible and easily controlled.
