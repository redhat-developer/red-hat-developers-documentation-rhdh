= Customizing the chat history storage in {ls-short}

By default, the {rcs-short} service stores chat history using an in memory database. This means that if you restart the Pod containing the server, the chat history is lost. You can manually configure {ls-short} to store the chat history persistently as a long-term backup with PostgreSQL by any of the following methods:

* {product-very-short} Operator
* {product-very-short} Helm chart

+
[WARNING]
====
If you configure {ls-short} to store chat history using PostgreSQL, prompts and responses are recorded and can be reviewed by your platform administrators. If any of your user's chat history contains any private, sensitive, or confidential information, this might have data privacy and security implications that you need to assess. For users that wish to have their chat data removed, they must request their respective platform administrator to perform this action. {company-name} does not collect (or have access to) any of this chat history data.

* When you are using {ls-short} on an Operator-installed {product-very-short} instance, in your {product-very-short} instance ConfigMap, update the `conversation-cache` field as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
 conversation_cache:
    type: postgres
    postgres:
      host: _<your_database_host>_
      port: _<your_database_port>_
      dbname: _<your_database_name>_
   	  user: _<your_user_name>_
	    password_path: postgres_password.txt
	    ca_cert_path: postgres_cert.crt
      ssl_mode: "require"

* When you are using {ls-short} on a Helm-installed {product-very-short} instance, in your {product-very-short} instance `values.yaml` file, update the `conversation-cache` field as shown in the following example:

 conversation_cache:
    type: postgres
    postgres:
