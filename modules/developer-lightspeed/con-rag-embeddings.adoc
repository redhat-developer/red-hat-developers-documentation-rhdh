= Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) embeddings

The {product} documentation serves as the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) data source.

RAG initialization occurs through an initialization container, which copies the RAG data to a shared volume. The Llama Stack sidecar then mounts this shared volume to access the RAG data. The Llama Stack service uses the resulting RAG embeddings in the vector database as a reference. This allows the service to provide citations to production documentation during the inference process.
