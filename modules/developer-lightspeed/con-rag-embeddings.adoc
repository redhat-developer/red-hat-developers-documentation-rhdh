= Retrieval Augmented Generation embeddings

The {product} documentation set serves as the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) data source.

RAG initialization occurs through an init container, which copies the RAG data to a shared volume. The Llama Stack sidecar then mounts this volume to access the data. The Llama Stack service uses the resulting RAG embeddings in the vector database as a tool. This tool allows the service to provide references to production documentation during the inference process.
