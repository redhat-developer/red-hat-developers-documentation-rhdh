{ls-short} is a virtual assistant you interact with using natural language. Using the {ls-short} interface, you send chat messages that {ls-short} transforms and sends to the large language model (LLM) provider you have configured for your environment. These messages could potentially contain information provided by your users about themselves, your cluster, cluster resources, or other aspects of your business or working environment.

{ls-short} has limited capabilities to filter or redact the information you provide to the LLM. Do not enter information into {ls-short} that you do not want to send to the LLM provider. To remind end users not to share private or confidential information, {ls-short} begins each new chat with an 'Important' message asking them not to “include personal or sensitive information” in their chat messages.
