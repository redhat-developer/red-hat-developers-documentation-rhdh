= Changing your LLM provider in {ls-short}

{ls-short} operates on a {developer-lightspeed-link}#con-about-bring-your-own-model_appendix-about-user-data-security[_Bring Your Own Model_] approach, meaning you must provide and configure access to your preferred Large Language Model (LLM) provider for the service to function. The Road-Core Service (RCS) acts as an intermediary layer that handles the configuration and setup of these LLM providers.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The LLM provider configuration section includes a mandatory dummy provider block. Due to limitations of Road Core, this dummy provider must remain present when working with Lightspeed. This block is typically marked with comments (# Start: Do not remove this block and # End: Do not remove this block) and must not be removed from the configuration file.
====

.Prerequisites

* The path to the file containing your API token must be accessible by the RCS container, requiring the file to be mounted to the RCS container.

.Procedure

You can define additional LLM providers using either of following methods:

* Recommended: In your Developer Lightspeed plugin configuration (the `lightspeed` section within the `lightspeed-app-config.yaml` file), define the new provider or providers under the `lightspeed.servers` key as shown in the following code:
+
[source,yaml]
----
lightspeed:
  servers:
    - id: _<my_new_provider>_
      url: _<my_new_url>_
      token: _<my_new_token>_
<<<<<<< HEAD
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In Developer preview, only one LLM server is supported at a time.
====
** Optional: You can set the `id`, `url`, and `token` values in a Kubernetes Secret and reference them as environment variables using the `envFrom` section, as shown in the following code:
+
[source,yaml]
----
containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: my-image
      envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: my-secret
----

* You can add new LLM providers by updating the `rcsconfig.yaml` file.
.. In the `llm_providers` section within your `rcsconfig.yaml` file, add your new provider configuration below the mandatory dummy provider block as shown in the following code:
+
[source,yaml]
----
llm_providers:
   # Start: Do not remove this block
    - name: dummy
      type: openai
      url: https://dummy.com
      models:
        - name: dummymodel
   # END: Do not remove this block
    - name: _<my_new_providers>_
      type: openai
      url: _<my_provider_url>_
      credentials_path: path/to/token
      disable_model_check: true
----
.. If you need to define a new provider in `rcsconfig.yaml`, you must configure the following critical parameters:
** `credentials_path`: Specifies the path to a `.txt` file that contains your API token. This file must be mounted and accessible by the RCS container.
** `disable_model_check`: Set this field to `true` to allow the RCS to locate models through the `/v1/models` endpoint of the provider. When you set this field to `true`, you avoid the need to define model names explicitly in the configuration.
