= Understanding internal developer platforms

An internal developer platform (IDP) is a curated set of tools and services that supports developer self-service. Instead of navigating multiple systems, developers use a unified interface to provision environments, deploy code, and access APIs.

Why IDPs matter::

IDPs address the challenges of modern software delivery by enabling self-service, enforcing standards, and improving the developer experience.

For organizations::

* *Scalability:* {product-very-short} enables consistent developer onboarding and application delivery across growing teams and environments.
* *Security:* Role-based access control (RBAC) and integration with enterprise systems ensure access is managed securely and in line with compliance requirements.
* *Operational efficiency:* By removing manual handoffs and centralizing key development workflows, {product-very-short} improves time to value and increases return on engineering investment.

For platform engineers::

* *Curated platforms:* Platform teams can design reusable templates and integrations aligned with organizational policies and developer needs.
* *Central configuration:* Infrastructure and policies are defined as code and centrally managed, reducing drift and maintenance overhead.
* *Governance at scale:* Policies and best practices are embedded into developer workflows using automation and templates, without adding friction to the process.

For developers::

* *Faster onboarding:* Developers can use learning paths, software templates, and software catalog to deploy compliant services within minutes, without depending on other teams for setup.
* *Reduced cognitive load:* Developers can find tools, documentation, and deployment environments in one place, eliminating the need to switch between systems or manage disconnected resources.
* *Self-service workflows:* Developers can create applications or environments on demand, without raising tickets or waiting for approvals.
* *Built-in standards:* Developers can use preconfigured templates that enforce secure, compliant workflows without requiring manual setup.
* *Cross-team visibility:* Developers can discover shared service catalogs and documentation to improve reuse and reduce duplication.
* *Higher productivity:* Developers can spend more time building features and less time configuring infrastructure or resolving toolchain inconsistencies.

.Key features

Centralized dashboard::
Access development tools, CI/CD pipelines, APIs, monitoring tools, and documentation from a single interface. Integrate with systems like Git, {ocp-brand-name}, Kubernetes, and JIRA.

Learning paths::
Guide developers through structured tutorials and onboarding steps. Help teams upskill with internal and Red Hat training resources in one place.

Plugins and integrations::
Extend {product-very-short} with verified plugins that add new functionality without downtime. Dynamically integrate with supported tools such as Tekton for pipelines, GitOps for deployment automation, Nexus Repository for artifact storage, and JFrog Artifactory. {product-very-short} also supports connecting to {ocp-brand-name}, CI/CD systems, and security scanners through Red Hat-curated extensions.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)::
Manage user access with robust security permissions tailored to organizational needs.

Software catalog::
Search, view, and manage services, APIs, and libraries from a central inventory. Track ownership, metadata, and component health in one place.

Software templates::
Accelerate project setup using preconfigured templates for CI/CD, runtime, and security. Standardize implementation while enabling developer autonomy.

Tech docs::
Create, store, and view technical documentation alongside code. Make content searchable, consistently formatted, and accessible through the portal.

Scalability::
Support growing teams and applications while maintaining access to the same tools and services.
