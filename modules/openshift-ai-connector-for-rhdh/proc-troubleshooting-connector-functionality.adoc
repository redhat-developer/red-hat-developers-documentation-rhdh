= Troubleshooting Connector functionality

The connector system consists of the two dynamic plugins and the three model catalog bridge sidecar containers. Generally speaking, the logs collected must be provided to {company-name} Support for analysis.

The actual contents of the diagnostic data are not part of any product guaranteed specification, and can change at any time.

== Checking Dynamic Plugins status

Validate that the dynamic plugins have been successfully installed into your {product-very-short} project Pod by using the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
oc logs -c install-dynamic-plugins deployment/<your {product-very-short} deployment>
----

The `install-dynamic-plugin` logs allow you to check the following installation logs for successful logs:

* `red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-model-catalog` (Entity Provider)
* `red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-catalog-techdoc-url-reader-backend` (TechDoc URL Reader)

== Inspecting plugin logs

View the {openshift-ai-connector-name}plugins in the `backstage-backend` container. Items to look for:

[cols="3,4,4"]
|===
|Plugin Component |Logger Service Target |Common Log Text

|Model Catalog Entity Provider
|`ModelCatalogResourceEntityProvider`
|`Discovering ResourceEntities from Model Server...`

|Model Catalog TechDoc URL Reader
|`ModelCatalogBridgeTechdocUrlReader`
|`ModelCatalogBridgeTechdocUrlReader.readUrl`
|===

To enable debug logging, set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `debug` on the `backstage-backend` container. For more information, see {monitoring-and-logging-book-link}[{monitoring-and-logging-book-title}].

== Inspecting the Model Catalog Bridge

The Model Catalog Bridge sidecars manage the data fetching and storage:

[IMPORTANT]
====
{openshift-ai-connector-name} collects feedback from users who engage with the feedback feature. If a user submits feedback, the feedback score (thumbs up or down), text feedback (if entered), the user query, and the LLM provider response are stored locally in the file system of the Pod. {company-name} does not have access to the collected feedback data.
====

. Check Cached Data (ConfigMap): The processed AI Model metadata is stored in a `ConfigMap`.
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get configmap bac-import-model -o json | jq -r '.binaryData | to_entries[] | "=== \(.key) ===\n" + (.value | @base64d | fromjson | .body | @base64d | fromjson | tostring)' | jq -R 'if startswith("=== ") then . else (. | fromjson) end'
----

. Check Location Service API: Confirm the location service is providing data to the {product-very-short} Entity Provider.
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
oc rsh -c backstage-backend deployment/<your {product-very-short} deployment>
curl http://localhost:9090/list
----

. Check Sidecar Container Logs:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc logs -c rhoai-normalizer deployment/<your {product-very-short} deployment>
oc logs -c storage-rest deployment/<your {product-very-short} deployment>
oc logs -c location deployment/<your {product-very-short} deployment>
