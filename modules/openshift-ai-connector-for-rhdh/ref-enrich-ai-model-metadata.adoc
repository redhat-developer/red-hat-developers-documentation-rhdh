= Enrich AI model metadata for enhanced {product} experience

While {rhoai-short} provides essential data, an AI platform engineer using {rhoai-short} can enrich the {backstage}/{product-very-short} experience by adding `custom properties` to the `ModelVersion` or `RegisteredModel` (or annotations to the `KServe InferenceService` if the model registry is not used) so that the {openshift-ai-connector-name} can add the information to the {product-very-short} entities it creates. For more details, see {rhoai-docs-link}/working_with_model_registries/index#editing-model-version-metadata-in-a-model-registry_model-registry[Editing model version metadata in a model registry].

|Property Key |Entity Field Populated |Description

|`API Spec`
|API Definition Tab
|The OpenAPI / Swagger JSON specification for the model REST API.

|`API Type`
|API Type
|Correlates to supported {product-very-short}/{backstage} API types (defaults to `openapi`).

|`TechDocs`
|TechDocs
|URL pointing to a Git repository that follows {product-very-short} TechDocs conventions for the Model Card. Use this setting only if the *Model Card to TechDocs* mapping is not active.

|`Homepage URL`
|Links
|A URL considered the home page for the model.

|`Owner`
|Owner
|Overrides the default OpenShift user as the entity owner.

|`Lifecycle`
|Lifecycle
|Serves a means to express the lifecycle notion of {product-very-short}/{backstage}.

|`How to use`
|Links
|A URL that points to usage documentation.

|`License`
|Links
|A URL to the license file of the model.

|`rhdh.modelcatalog.io/model-name`
|Annotations
|A key piece of metadata is the name of the model used when communicating with the model server's REST API.  {openshift-ai-connector-name} stores this name in the `rhdh.modelcatalog.io/model-name` annotation  on the `Resource` entity, and will default this annotation's value to the combined names of the `ResourceModel` and `ModelVersion` in the model registry, or the `KServe InferenceService` name if the model registry is not used, as those often line up with the model name used when communicating with the model server's REST API. But the names are not guaranteed to match.  When the names do not match, provide the correct model name for model REST API invocations.
