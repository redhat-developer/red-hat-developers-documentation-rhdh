= Enabling the Microsoft Azure authentication provider

{product} includes a Microsoft Azure authentication provider that can authenticate users by using OAuth.

.Prerequisites
. You have the permission to register an application in Microsoft Azure.
. You link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/{product-version}/html-single/administration_guide_for_red_hat_developer_hub/index#assembly-add-custom-app-file-openshift_admin-rhdh[added a custom {product-short} application configuration].

.Procedure
. To allow {product-short} to authenticate with Microsoft Azure, create an OAuth Application in Microsoft Azure.

.. Go to link:https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade[*Azure Portal > App registrations*], and create an *App Registration* for {product-short}.

.. On your *App registration* overview page, add a new *Web platform configuration*, with the configuration:

*Redirect URI*:: Enter the backend authentication URI set in {product-short}: `pass:c,a,q[https://_<APP_FQDN>_/api/auth/microsoft/handler/frame]`
*Front-channel logout URL*:: Leave blank.
*Implicit grant and hybrid flows*:: Leave all checkboxes cleared.

.. On the *API permissions* tab, click *Add Permission*, then add the following *Delegated permission* for the
*Microsoft Graph API*:
+
* `email`
* `offline_access`
* `openid`
* `profile`
* `User.Read`
* Optional custom scopes of the Microsoft Graph API that you define both here and in the {product-short} configuration (`app-config-rhdh.yaml`).
+
[NOTE]
====
Your company might require you to grant admin consent for these permissions.
Even if your company does not require admin consent, you might do so as it means users do not need to individually consent the first time they access backstage.
To grant admin consent, a directory admin must go to the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/user-admin-consent-overview[admin consent] page and click *Grant admin consent for COMPANY NAME*.
====


.. Go to the *Certificates & Secrets* page, then the *Client secrets* tab, and create a new client secret.

.. Save for the next step:
- **Directory (tenant) ID**
- **Application (client) ID**
- **Application (client) secret**

. To add your Microsoft Azure credentials to {product-short}, add the following key/value pairs to your {product-short} secrets, such as `secrets-rhdh`:
+
`AUTH_AZURE_TENANT_ID`:: Enter your saved *Directory (tenant) ID*.
`AUTH_AZURE_CLIENT_ID`:: Enter your saved *Application (client) ID*.
`AUTH_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`:: Enter your saved *Application (client) secret*.

. Set up the Microsoft Azure authentication provider in your {product-short} custom configuration, such as `app-config-rhdh`:
+
.`app-config-rhdh.yaml` fragment

<1> Marking the environment as production hides the **Guest** login in the {product-short} home page.
<2> Optional for single-tenant applications.
You can reduce login friction for users with accounts in multiple tenants by automatically filtering out accounts from other tenants.
If you want to use this parameter for a single-tenant application, uncomment and enter the tenant ID.
If your application registration is multi-tenant, leave this parameter blank.
For more information, see link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/home-realm-discovery-policy[Home Realm Discovery].
<3> Optional for additional scopes.
To add scopes for the application registration, uncomment and enter the list of scopes that you want to add.
The default and mandatory value is `['user.read']`.
<4> To enable the Microsoft Azure provider as default sign-in provider.
<5> To enable authentication without provisioning the software catalog.

[NOTE]
====
Optional for environments with restrictions on outgoing access, such as firewall rules.
If your environment has outgoing access restrictions make sure your Backstage backend has access to the following hosts:

* `login.microsoftonline.com`: To get and exchange authorization codes and access tokens.

* `graph.microsoft.com`: To fetch user profile information (as seen in this source code).
If this host is unreachable, users might see an _Authentication failed, failed to fetch user profile_ error when they attempt to log in.
