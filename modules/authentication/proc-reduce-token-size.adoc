[id="reduce-token-size"]
= Reduce the size of issued tokens

[role="_abstract"]
By default, the authentication backend issues user identity tokens with ownership references of the user in the `ent` claim of the JSON Web Token (JWT) payload.
This makes it easier for consumers of the token to resolve ownership of the user.
However, depending on the structure of your organization and how you resolve ownership claims, the tokens can grow large and cause HTTP errors that prevent you from accessing parts of {product-very-short}.
Use the `omitIdentityTokenOwnershipClaim` flag to remove the `ent` claim from tokens and reduce their size.

.Procedure

. In the `{my-app-config-file}` file, set `omitIdentityTokenOwnershipClaim` to `true` as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
auth:
  omitIdentityTokenOwnershipClaim: true
