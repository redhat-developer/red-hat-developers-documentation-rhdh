`domainHint`::
* Leave this parameter empty, or enter the tenant ID when your application registration is single-tenant.
* Leave this parameter empty when your application registration is multi-tenant.
* Enter the tenant ID to reduce login friction for users with accounts in multiple tenants, by automatically filtering out accounts from other tenants.
+
For more information, see link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/home-realm-discovery-policy[Home Realm Discovery].

`additionalScopes`::
Enter the list of additional scopes to add scopes for the application registration.
The default and mandatory value lists following scopes:
* `openid`
* `offline_access`
* `profile`
* `email`
* `User.Read`

`sessionDuration`::
Lifespan of the user session.
Enter a duration in `ms` library (such as '24h', '2 days'), ISO duration, or "human duration" format.

`signIn.resolvers`::
After successful authentication, {product-short} resolves the user signing in to an existing user in the {product-short} catalog.
To best match users securely for your use case, consider configuring a specific resolver.
+
Enter the resolver list to override the default resolver: `userIdMatchingUserEntityAnnotation`.
+
The authentication provider tries each sign-in resolver in order until it succeeds, and fails if none succeed.
+
[WARNING]
====
In production mode, configure only one resolver to make sure users are securely matched.
====

`resolver`::
Enter the sign-in resolver name.
Available resolvers:

`emailMatchingUserEntityAnnotation`:::
Use this resolver to look up the user by matching their Microsoft email to the email entity annotation.

`emailLocalPartMatchingUserEntityName`:::
Use this resolver to look up the user by matching their Microsoft email user name to the user entity name.

`emailMatchingUserEntityProfileEmail`:::
Use this resolver to look up the user by matching their Microsoft email to the user entity profile email.

`dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog`::
Enter `true` to configure the sign-in resolver to bypass the user provisioning requirement in the {product-short} software catalog.
+
[WARNING]
====
In production mode, do not enable `dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog`.
