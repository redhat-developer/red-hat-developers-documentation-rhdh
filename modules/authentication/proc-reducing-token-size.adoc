[id="reducing-token-size"]
= Reducing the size of issued tokens

By default, the authentication backend issues user identity tokens with ownership references of the user in the `ent` claim of the JSON Web Token (JWT) payload.
This makes it easier for consumers of the token to resolve ownership of the user.
However, depending on the structure of your organization and how you resolve ownership claims, the tokens can grow large and cause HTTP errors that prevent you from accessing parts of {product-very-short}.
Use the `omitIdentityTokenOwnershipClaim` flag to remove the `ent` claim from tokens and reduce their size.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Without the `ent` claim in the token, consumers of the token must call the `/v1/userinfo` endpoint on the auth backend to fetch the ownership references of the user.
However, there is usually no action required for the consumers.
Clients still receive the full set of claims during authentication, and plugin backends that use the `UserInfoService` to access the ownership references from user credentials can call the `userinfo` endpoint if necessary.
====

.Procedure

. In the `{my-app-config-file}` file, set `omitIdentityTokenOwnershipClaim` to `true` as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
auth:
  omitIdentityTokenOwnershipClaim: true
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When you enable the `omitIdentityTokenOwnershipClaim` flag, it is important that any custom sign-in resolvers return directly the result of the sign-in method.

Example of a correct setup::

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
return ctx.issueToken({
  claims: { sub: entityRef, ent: [entityRef] },
});
----
