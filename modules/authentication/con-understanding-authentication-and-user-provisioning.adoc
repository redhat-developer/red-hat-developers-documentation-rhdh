= Understanding authentication and user provisioning

Learn about the authentication process from creating user and group entities in the software catalog to user sign-in, and how authentication and catalog plugins enable each step.
Understanding this process is essential for successfully configuring your {product-short} instance, securing access through authorization, and enabling features that rely on synchronized user and group data.

To fully enable catalog features, provision user and group data from the Identity Provider to the {product-short} software catalog.
Catalog provider plugins handle this task asynchronously.
These plugins query the Identity Provider (IdP) for relevant user and group information, and create or update corresponding entities in the {product-short} catalog.
Scheduled provisioning ensures that the catalog accurately reflects the users and groups in your organization.

When a user attempts to access {product-short}, {product-short} redirects them to a configured authentication provider, such as {rhbk-brand-name} ({rhbk}), GitHub, or {azure-brand-name}.
This external IdP is responsible for authenticating the user.

On successful authentication, the {product-short} authentication plugin, configured in your `{my-app-config-file}` file, processes the response from the IdP, resolves the identity in the {product-short} software catalog, and establishes a user session within {product-short}.

Configuring authentication and user provisioning is critical for several reasons.

* Securing your {product-short} instance by ensuring only authenticated users can gain access.
* Enabling authorization by allowing you to define access controls based on user and group memberships synchronized from your IdP.
* Provisioning user and group data to the catalog is necessary for various catalog features that rely on understanding entity ownership and relationships between users, groups, and software components.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Without this provisioning step, features such as displaying who owns a catalog entity might not function correctly.

[TIP]
====
To explore {product-short} features in a non-production environment, you can:

* To use {product-short} without external IdP, enable the guest user to skip configuring authentication and authorization, log in as the guest user, and access all {product-short} features.

* To use {product-short} without authorization policies and features relying on the software catalog, you can enable the `dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog` resolver option.
This setting bypasses the check requiring a user to be in the catalog but still enforces authentication.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-short} uses a one-way synchronization model, where user and group data flow from your Identity Provider to the {product-short} software catalog.
As a result,
deleting users or groups manually through the {product-short} Web UI or REST API might be ineffective or cause inconsistencies,
since {product-short} will create those entities again during the next import.
