  environment: production
  providers:
    github:
      production:
        clientId: ${GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}

            - resolver: usernameMatchingUserEntityName
              dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog: true
signInPage: github
----

`callbackUrl`::
Enter the callback URL that GitHub uses when initiating an OAuth flow, such as: __<your_intermediate_service_url/handler>__.
Define it when {product-short} is not the immediate receiver, such as in cases when you use one OAuth app for many {product-short} instances.

`sessionDuration`::
Enter the user session lifespan, in `ms` library format (such as '24h', '2 days'), ISO duration, or "human duration".

`signIn`::

`resolvers`:::
After successful authentication, {product-short} resolves the user signing in to an existing user in the {product-short} catalog.
Configure a specific resolver to best match users securely for your use case..
+
Enter the resolver list to override the default resolver: `usernameMatchingUserEntityName`.
+
The authentication provider tries each sign-in resolver in order until it succeeds. If none of the attempts succeed, the sign-in fails.
+
[WARNING]
====
In production mode, configure only one resolver to make sure users are securely matched.
====

`resolver`::::
Enter the sign-in resolver name.
Available resolvers:

* `usernameMatchingUserEntityName`
* `preferredUsernameMatchingUserEntityName`
* `emailMatchingUserEntityProfileEmail`

`dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog`::::
Enter `true` to configure the sign-in resolver to bypass the user provisioning requirement in the {product-short} software catalog.
+
[WARNING]
====
In production more, do not enable `dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog`.
