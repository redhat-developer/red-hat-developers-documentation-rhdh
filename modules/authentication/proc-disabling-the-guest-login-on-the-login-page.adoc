= Disabling the Guest login

To prevent users from logging in as a guest on the login page, disable the guest login option.

.Procedure

* To disable the guest login option, in the {my-app-config-file} file, set the authentication environment to production, and do not allow the guest provider:
+
[source,yaml]
----
auth:
  environment: production
  provider:
    guest:
      dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment: false
----
+
[TIP]
----
As the `provider.guest.dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment` default value is `false`, you might also just set the authentication environment to production, and remove the `provider.guest` section.
----

.Verification
. Go to the login page of your {product-short} instance.
. Verify that the option to log in as a guest is no longer available on the login page.
