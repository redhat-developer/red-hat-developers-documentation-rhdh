= Disabling the Guest login

To prevent users from logging in as a guest on the login page, disable the guest login option.

.Procedure

* In the {my-app-config-file} file, set the authentication environment to `production`, and disable the guest provider:
+
[source,yaml]
----
auth:
  environment: production
  provider:
    guest:
      dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment: false
----
+
[TIP]
----
Because the `provider.guest.dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment` default value is `false`, you can also disable the guest provider by setting the environment to `production` and removing the `provider.guest` section.
----

.Verification
. Go to the login page of your {product-short} instance.
. Verify that the option to log in as a guest is no longer available on the login page.
