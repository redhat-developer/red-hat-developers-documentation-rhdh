{product-short} audit logs can include the following catalog events:

`CatalogEntityAncestryFetch`:: Tracks `GET` requests to the `/entities/by-name/:kind/:namespace/:name/ancestry` endpoint, which returns the ancestry of an entity
`CatalogEntityBatchFetch`:: Tracks `POST` requests to the `/entities/by-refs` endpoint, which returns a batch of entities
`CatalogEntityDeletion`:: Tracks `DELETE` requests to the `/entities/by-uid/:uid` endpoint, which deletes an entity

[NOTE]
====
If the parent location of the deleted entity is still present in the catalog, then the entity is restored in the catalog during the next processing cycle.
====

`CatalogEntityFacetFetch`:: Tracks `GET` requests to the `/entity-facets` endpoint, which returns the facets of an entity
`CatalogEntityFetch`:: Tracks `GET` requests to the `/entities` endpoint, which returns a list of entities
`CatalogEntityFetchByName`:: Tracks `GET` requests to the `/entities/by-name/:kind/:namespace/:name` endpoint, which returns an entity matching the specified entity reference, for example, `<kind>:<namespace>/<name>`
`CatalogEntityFetchByUid`:: Tracks `GET` requests to the `/entities/by-uid/:uid` endpoint, which returns an entity matching the unique ID of the specified entity
`CatalogEntityRefresh`:: Tracks `POST` requests to the `/entities/refresh` endpoint, which schedules the specified entity to be refreshed
`CatalogEntityValidate`:: Tracks `POST` requests to the `/entities/validate` endpoint, which validates the specified entity

[NOTE]
====
A location is a marker that references other places to look for catalog data.
====

`CatalogLocationAnalyze`:: Tracks `POST` requests to the `/locations/analyze` endpoint, which analyzes the specified location
`CatalogLocationDeletion`:: Tracks `DELETE` requests to the `/locations/:id` endpoint, which deletes a location and all child entities associated with it
`CatalogLocationFetch`:: Tracks `GET` requests to the `/locations` endpoint, which returns a list of locations
`CatalogLocationFetchByEntityRef`:: Tracks `GET` requests to the `/locations/by-entity` endpoint, which returns a list of locations associated with the specified entity reference
`CatalogLocationFetchById`:: Tracks `GET` requests to the `/locations/:id` endpoint, which returns a location matching the specified location ID
