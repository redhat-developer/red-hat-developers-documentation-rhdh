= Customizing the Tech Radar page in {product}

In {product}, the Tech Radar page is provided by the `tech-radar` dynamic plugin, which is disabled by default. For information about enabling dynamic plugins in {product} see link:{LinkPluginsGuide}[Configuring plugins in {product}].

In {product}, you can configure Learning Paths by passing the data into the `app-config.yaml` file as a proxy. The base Tech Radar URL must include the `/developer-hub/tech-radar` proxy.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the use of overlapping `pathRewrites` for both the `tech-radar` and `homepage` quick access proxies, you must create the `tech-radar` configuration (`^api/proxy/developer-hub/tech-radar`) before you create the `homepage` configuration (`^/api/proxy/developer-hub`).

For more information about customizing the Home page in {product}, see xref:proc-customize-rhdh-homepage_rhdh-getting-started[Customizing the Home page in {product}].
====

You can provide data to the Tech Radar page from the following sources:

* JSON files hosted on GitHub or GitLab.
* A dedicated service that provides the Tech Radar data in JSON format using an API.

== Using hosted JSON files to provide data to the Tech Radar page

.Prerequisites

You have installed {product} by using either the Operator or Helm chart.
For more information, see xref:{installing-on-ocp-book-url}#assembly-install-rhdh-ocp[{installing-on-ocp-book-title}].

.Procedure

To access the data from the JSON files, complete the following step:

* Add the following code to the `app-config.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
proxy:
  endpoints:
    # Other Proxies
    # customize developer hub instance
    '/developer-hub':
      target: <DOMAIN_URL> # i.e https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
      pathRewrite:
        '^/api/proxy/developer-hub/tech-radar': <path to json file> # i.e /janus-idp/backstage-showcase/main/packages/app/public/tech-radar/data-default.json
	 '^/api/proxy/developer-hub': <path to json file> # i.e /janus-idp/backstage-showcase/main/packages/app/public/homepage/data.json
      changeOrigin: true
      secure: true

      # Change to "false" in case of using self hosted cluster with a self-signed certificate
      headers:
	<HEADER_KEY>: <HEADER_VALUE> # optional and can be passed as needed i.e Authorization can be passed for private GitHub repo and PRIVATE-TOKEN can be passed for private GitLab repo
----

== Using a dedicated service to provide data to the Tech Radar page

When using a dedicated service, you can do the following:

* Use the same service to provide the data to all configurable {product-short} pages or use a different service for each page.
* Use the https://github.com/redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider[`red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider`] as an example service, which provides data for both the Home and Tech Radar pages. The `red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider` service provides the same data as default {product-short} data. You can fork the `red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider` service repository from GitHub and modify it with your own data, if required.
* Deploy the `red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider` service and the {product-short} Helm chart on the same cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {product} using Helm Chart.
For more information, see xref:{installing-on-ocp-book-url}#assembly-install-rhdh-ocp-helm[{installing-on-ocp-book-title} with the Helm chart].

.Procedure

To use a separate service to provide the Tech Radar data, complete the following steps:

. Add the following code to the `app-config-rhdh.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
proxy:
  endpoints:
    # Other Proxies
    '/developer-hub/tech-radar':
      target: ${TECHRADAR_DATA_URL}
      changeOrigin: true
      # Change to "false" in case of using self hosted cluster with a self-signed certificate
      secure: true
----
where the `TECHRADAR_DATA_URL` is defined as `pass:c[http://<SERVICE_NAME>/tech-radar]`, for example, `pass:c[http://rhdh-customization-provider/tech-radar]`.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can define the `TECHRADAR_DATA_URL` by adding it to `rhdh-secrets` or by directly replacing it with its value in your custom ConfigMap.
====
+
. Delete the {product-short} pod to ensure that the new configurations are loaded correctly.
