= Configuring a GitHub App in {product-short}

To add GitHub authentication for {product-short}, you must configure the GitHub App in your `app-config.yaml` file.

The GitHub authentication provider uses the following configuration keys:

* `clientId`: the client ID that you generated on GitHub. For example: b59241722e3c3b4816e2
* `clientSecret`: the client secret tied to the generated client ID.
* `enterpriseInstanceUrl` (optional): the base URL for a GitHub Enterprise instance. For example: `pass:c[https://ghe.<company>.com]`. The `enterpriseInstanceUrl` is only needed for GitHub Enterprise.
* `callbackUrl` (optional): the callback URL that GitHub uses when initiating an OAuth flow. For example: pass:c[https://your-intermediate-service.com/handler]. The `callbackUrl` is only needed if {product-short} is not the immediate receiver, such as in cases when you use one OAuth app for many {product-short} instances.

To configure the GitHub App, add the provider configuration to your `app-config.yaml` file under the root auth configuration. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
auth:
 environment: production
 providers:
   github:
     production:
       clientId: ${GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID}
       clientSecret: ${GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET}
       ## uncomment if using GitHub Enterprise
       # enterpriseInstanceUrl: ${GITHUB_URL}
----
