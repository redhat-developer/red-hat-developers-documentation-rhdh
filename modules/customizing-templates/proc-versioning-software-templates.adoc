= Versioning a Software Template in {product}

As a platform administrator, you can version Software Templates by using the existing custom actions `catalog:scaffolded-from` and `catalog:template:version` within the scaffolder backend module. By using these custom actions, you can track the scaffolder template version and the corresponding version of the entities created from it, which improves lifecycle management.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator rights to {product}.

.Procedure

To add versioning to a Software Template yaml file, modify the Software Template that you want to update and do either of the following steps:

* Include the `backstage.io/template-version` annotation in your template. When this annotation is present in your template, it will be automatically used to annotate your catalog entity.

* Pass the `backstage.io/template-version` annotation as input to the action. This method takes precedence over the annotation in the template itself. It allows the user running the template to specify the version they wish to generate.
