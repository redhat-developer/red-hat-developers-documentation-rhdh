= Enabling Software Template version update notifications in {product}

As a platform engineer, you can enable notification alerts for template version updates using the `@backstage-community/plugin-catalog-backend-module-scaffolder-relation-processor` module, an extension to the `catalog-backend` plugin. When enabled, this module automatically notifies component owners whenever the Software Template used to generate their components is updated to a new version.

This functionality uses the `spec.scaffoldedFrom` field in catalog entities. This field links Software Templates to the entities they have scaffolded. By tracking this relationship, the module helps teams stay informed and take advantage of the latest improvements or fixes.

The `plugin-catalog-backend-module-scaffolder-relation-processor` module is disabled by default.


.Prerequisites

* You have installed and configured the {product-very-short} notification plugins:
** backend: `@backstage/plugin-notifications-backend`
** frontend: `@backstage/plugin-notifications`

.Procedure

. Open your {product-very-short} `{my-app-config-file}` file.
. Add the following conifugration to the `scaffolder` section to enable Software Template update notifications
. Optional: To customize the notification title and description, add the `message` block:
+
[source,yaml]
----
scaffolder:
  notifications:
    templateUpdate:
      enabled: true
      message:
        title: 'Custom title for $ENTITY_DISPLAY_NAME'
        description: 'Custom description'
----
+
where:

`enabled`:: Set to `true` to enable the notification. Default value is `false`.
`message:title`:: Enter the notification title.
`message:description`:: Enter the notification description.

[NOTE]
====
The `message:title` and `message:description` fields support the `$ENTITY_DISPLAY_NAME` variable. The system replaces this variable with the title (or the name, if the title is missing) of the scaffolded entity.
====

.Verification
. Log in to your `{product}` instance.
. In the left navigation menu, verify that the *Notifications* item appears.
. Update the version of a Software Template and verify that the owner of a component scaffolded from that template receives a notification.
