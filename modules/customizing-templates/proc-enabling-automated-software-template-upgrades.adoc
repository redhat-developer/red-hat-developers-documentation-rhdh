= Enabling automated Software Template upgrades

To automate the delivery of template updates to your software components, you must enable pull request (PR) generation in your configuration. This action makes sure that downstream components stay synchronized with the latest security fixes and best practices without manual intervention.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator rights to {product}.
* You have a designated automation bot user account in your Git provider (GitHub or GitLab).

.Procedure
. In your `{product} app-config.yaml` file, locate the `scaffolder` section. 
. Add the `upgrades` configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
scaffolder:
  upgrades:
    enabled: true
    botUser: "rhdh-automation-bot" # Name of your automation bot
    prInformation:
      title: "[Template Upgrade]: Update {templateName} from {oldVersion} to {newVersion}"
      description: "This automated PR synchronizes your component with the latest template release."
----
. Save the file.
. Restart the {product-very-short} instance.

.Verification
* Release a new template version. 
* Confirm that the automation bot creates a new branch and a corresponding PR in a component repository that uses that template.
