= Upgrading a component from a Software Template version

When a Softare Template update is available, {product} creates an automated pull request (PR) in your repository. You must review and merge this PR to apply the latest template changes to your component.

.Procedure
. Open the PR created by the automation bot in your source control system.
. Review the calculated differences (diff) to understand how the template changes affect your existing code.
. Resolve any merge conflicts using your standard Git workflow.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a conflict is too complex for the automation to resolve, the system skips the PR creation. You must then manually apply the template changes.
====
. Merge the PR into your target branch (for example, `main`).

.Verification
* Verify that your component reflects the new template version and that the build passes after the merge.
