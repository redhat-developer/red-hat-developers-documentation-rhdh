= Registering a GitHubâ€‹ App

In a GitHub App, you configure the allowed scopes as part of that application, therefore, you must verify the scope that your plugins require. The scope information is available in the plugin README files.

To add GitHub authentication, complete the steps in link:https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app[Registering a GitHub App] on the GitHub website.

Use the following examples to enter the information about your production environment into the required fields on the *Register new GitHub App* page:

* Application name: {product}
* Homepage URL:  `pass:c[https://developer-hub-<NAMESPACE_NAME>.<KUBERNETES_ROUTE_HOST>]`
* Authorization callback URL: `pass:c[https://developer-hub-<NAMESPACE_NAME>.<KUBERNETES_ROUTE_HOST>/api/auth/github/handler/frame]`

NOTE: The Homepage URL points to the {product-short} front end, while the authorization callback URL points to the authentication provider backend.
