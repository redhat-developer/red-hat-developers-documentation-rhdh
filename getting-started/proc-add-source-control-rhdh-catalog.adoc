= Adding source control for Catalog in {product}

To populate the Catalog in {product}, you need to add software templates, and to add the templates, you must enable a source control such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

== Setting GitHub integration and authentication

The GitHub integration and authentication is required to enable the GitHub plugins in {product}.

.Prerequisites

* You have a GitHub account.
* You have an account in Red Hat OpenShift

.Procedure

. In OpenShift, click *ConfigMap*.
. Modify your `app-config-rhdh` file to include the GitHub configuration as follows:
+
--
[source]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: app-config-rhdh
data:
  app-config-rhdh.yaml: |
    app:
      title: Red Hat Developer Hub
    integrations:
      github:
        - host: github.com
          apps:
            - appId: ${GITHUB_APP_APP_ID}
              clientId: ${GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID}
              clientSecret: ${GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET}
              webhookUrl: ${GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_URL}
              webhookSecret: ${GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET}
              privateKey: |
                ${GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY}
    auth:
      # see https://backstage.io/docs/auth/ to learn about auth providers
      environment: development
      providers:
        github:
          development:
            clientId: ${GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID}
            clientSecret: ${GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET}
----
--

. Click *Save*.
. Create a key or value Secret file named `rhdh-secrets` using the environment variables as keys from the previous code snippet by following the steps below:
+
--
.. In Red Hat OpenShift, go to the *Secrets* tab and click *Create*.
.. Enter *Secret name* as `rhdh-secrets`.
.. Add environment variables as *Key* and *Value* and click *Create*.
--

. To log in using your GitHub application, ensure that the *Callback URL* in your GitHub application is configured as follows:
+
--
`https://developer-hub-<NAMESPACE_NAME>.<OPENSHIFT_ROUTE_HOST>/api/auth/github/handler/frame`

In the previous example of Callback URL, `OPENSHIFT_ROUTE_HOST` is the API URL added into the *Root Schema -> global -> clusterRouteBase* field.

The following is an example of the Callback URL:

[NOTE]
====
To access the GitHub security insights widget on the Overview page in {product-short}, ensure that your GitHub application has Read-only Dependabot Alerts permissions.
====
--

. Navigate to the *Helm* tab and select *Upgrade*.
. Under *Root Schema → Backstage Chart Schema → Backstage Parameters → Backstage container environment variables from existing Secrets*, add `rhdh-secrets` as value.
. Click *Upgrade*.

== Enabling GitHub discovery in {product}

You can enable GitHub discoverability for your components in {product-short}, such as any repositories that contain `catalog-info.yaml` file.

.Prerequisites

* You have set up the GitHub integration. For more information, see <<Setting GitHub integration and authentication>>. 

.Procedure

. In Red Hat Openshift, go to the *Helm* tab and upgrade the _Developer Hub_ release.
. Under *global → Dynamic plugins configuration → List of dynamic plugins that should be installed in the backstage application. → Package specification of the dynamic plugin to install. It should be usable by the `npm pack` command.*, add the following value:
+
--
`./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-dynamic`

image::rhdh/enable-gh-discovery.png[]
--

. Click *Upgrade*.
. Add the following code in the ConfigMap:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: app-config-rhdh
data:
  app-config-rhdh.yaml: |
    ...
      catalog: 
        providers: 
          github: 
            providerId: 
              organization: '${GITHUB_ORG}'
            schedule: 
              frequency: 
                minutes: 30
              initialDelay: 
                seconds: 15
              timeout: 
                minutes: 3
    ...
----

In the previous code, replace `${GITHUB_ORG}` with the GitHub organization from where you want to discover the components. Also, if there is a single provider, then following code can be added in the ConfigMap:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: app-config-rhdh
data:
  app-config-rhdh.yaml: |
    ...
    catalog:
      providers:
        github:
          organization: ${GITHUB_ORG}
          schedule:
            frequency: { minutes: 1 }
            timeout: { minutes: 1 }
            initialDelay: { seconds: 100 } 
    ...
----

The `providerId` in the previous code is required to identify the provider when there is a list of them.
--

. Click *Save*.

== Enabling GitHub organization member discovery in {product}

You can also enable GitHub discoverability for the members of your GitHub organization.

.Prerequisites

* You have set up the GitHub integration. For more information, see <<Setting GitHub integration and authentication>>. 

.Procedure

. In Red Hat Openshift, go to the *Helm* tab and upgrade the _Developer Hub_ release.
. Under *global → Dynamic plugins configuration → List of dynamic plugins that should be installed in the backstage application. → Package specification of the dynamic plugin to install. It should be usable by the `npm pack` command.*, add the following value:
+
--
`./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-org-dynamic`

image::rhdh/enable-gh-member-discovery.png[]
--

. Click *Upgrade*.
. Add the following code in the ConfigMap:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: app-config-rhdh
data:
  app-config-rhdh.yaml: |
    ...
    catalog:
      providers:
        githubOrg:
          default:
            id: production
            orgUrl: '${GITHUB_ORG_URL}'
    ...
----

In the previous code, replace `${GITHUB_ORG_URL}` with the GitHub organization you want to ingest users from.
