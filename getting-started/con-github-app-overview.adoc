= GitHub App​ overview

GitHub Apps are generally preferred to OAuth apps because they use fine-grained permissions, give more control over which repositories the application can access, and use short-lived tokens. For more information, see link:https://docs.github.com/en/apps/overview[GitHub Apps overview] in the GitHub documentation.
