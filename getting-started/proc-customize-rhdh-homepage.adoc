= Customizing the Home page in {product}

In {product}, the Home page data is configurable, which can be passed into the `app-config.yaml` file as a proxy. You can provide the Home page data using the following ways:

* Using JSON files that are hosted or GitHub or GitLab. To access the data from the JSON files, you can add the following code in the `app-config.yaml` file:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
proxy:
  endpoints:
    # Other Proxies
    # customize developer hub instance
    '/developer-hub':
      target: <DOMAIN_URL> # i.e https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
      pathRewrite:
        '^/api/proxy/developer-hub': <path to json file> # i.e /janus-idp/backstage-showcase/main/packages/app/public/homepage/data.json
      changeOrigin: true
      secure: true
      # Change to "false" in case of using self hosted cluster with a self-signed certificate
      headers:
	<HEADER_KEY>: <HEADER_VALUE> # optional and can be passed as needed i.e Authorization can be passed for private GitHub repo and PRIVATE-TOKEN can be passed for private GitLab repo
----
--

* Using a separate service that provides the Home page data in JSON format using an API.
+
--
[NOTE]
====
It is not necessary that the same service provides the Home page and Tech Radar data.
====

You can use the https://github.com/redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider[`red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider`] as an example service, which provides data for both Home page and Tech Radar. The `red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider` service provides the same data as default {product-short} data. You can fork the `red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider` service repository from GitHub and modify it with your own data, if required.
--

This section describes how you can deploy the `red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider` service onto the cluster where the {product-short} Helm Chart is deployed.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {product} using Helm Chart. For more information, see xref:proc-install-rhdh-helm_rhdh-getting-started[].

.Procedure

. In Red Hat OpenShift, select *+Add* and click *Import from Git* option.
. Add the URL of your Git repository to the *Git Repo URL* field.
+
--
To use the `red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider` service, you can add the URL of https://github.com/redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider[red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider] repository.
--

. In the *General* section, rename the value in the *Name* field to *rhdh-customization-provider* and click *Create*.
. Go to the *Advanced Options* and copy the value from the *Target Port*.
+
--
The *Target Port* is used to automatically generate a Kubernetes or OpenShift service to communicate with.
--

. To view the service, navigate to the *OpenShift Administrator* view and go to the *Networking -> Service* section.
+
--
You can also view the *Service Resources* in the Topology view.

If you follow this procedure with examples, then `rhdh-customization-provider` service is called and contains the 8080 port. The provided API URL for the Home page must return the data in JSON format as shown in the following example:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "title": "Dropdown 1",
    "isExpanded": false,
    "links": [
      {
        "iconUrl": "https://imagehost.com/image.png",
        "label": "Dropdown 1 Item 1",
        "url": "https://example.com/"
      },
      {
        "iconUrl": "https://imagehost2.org/icon.png",
        "label": "Dropdown 1 Item 2",
        "url": ""
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "title": "Dropdown 2",
    "isExpanded": true,
    "links": [
      {
        "iconUrl": "http://imagehost3.edu/img.jpg",
        "label": "Dropdown 2 Item 1",
        "url": "http://example.com"
      }
    ]
  }
]
----

If the request call fails or is not configured, the {product-short} instance falls back to the default local data.

To access the Home page in {product}, the base URL must include the `/developer-hub` proxy.
--

. Add the following code to the `app-config-rhdh.yaml` file:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
proxy:
  endpoints:
    # Other Proxies
    # customize developer hub instance
    '/developer-hub':
      target: ${HOMEPAGE_DATA_URL}
      changeOrigin: true
      # Change to "false" in case of using self-hosted cluster with a self-signed certificate
      secure: true
----

Ensure that the API request call returns the response in JSON format.
--

. Define the `HOMEPAGE_DATA_URL` as http://<SERVICE_NAME>:8080. For example, `http://rhdh-customization-provider:8080`.
+
--
You can replace the `HOMEPAGE_DATA_URL` by adding the URL to `rhdh-secrets` or directly replacing it in your custom ConfigMap.
--

. Delete the {product-short} Pod to pull in the changes.
+
--
If the images or icons do not load, then whitelist them by adding your image or icon host URLs to the content security policyâ€™s (csp) `img-src` in your custom ConfigMap as follows:

[source]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: app-config-rhdh
data:
  app-config-rhdh.yaml: |
    app:
      title: Red Hat Developer Hub
    backend:
      csp:
        connect-src:
          - "'self'"
          - 'http:'
          - 'https:'
        img-src:
          - "'self'"
          - 'data:'
          - <image host url 1>
          - <image host url 2>
          - <image host url 3>
    # Other Configurations
----

After that, delete the pod to ensure that the new configurations are loaded correctly.
