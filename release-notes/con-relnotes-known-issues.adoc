This section lists known issues with {product} {product-version}:

RBAC: CSV repopulates database whenever there is a server restart link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-850[[RHIDP-850]]::

The `policy.csv file` is used to load permissions into {product-short}. There may be instances of overlapping permissions, and the permissions can be reloaded into the database.

Validation is not working for create role API link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-852[[RHIDP-852]]::

The validation process in the create role API is currently ineffective, allowing the creation of roles that are invalid. This results in input errors when attempting to update or delete these roles.

RBAC backend plugin - policy change requires server restart link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-853[[RHIDP-853]]::

Manually manipulating the database leads to inconsistent behavior, causing the manipulated permission or role to not apply correctly within the RBAC plugin.

Third-party, user-added plugin compatibility link:link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-447[[RHIDP-447]]::

A third-party, user-added plugin added to {product-short} can be updated without a necessary update to your {product-short} instance which may cause a compatibility issue. Similarly, your {product-short} instance can be updated which may also cause a compatibility issue with an existing third-party, user-added plugin.
