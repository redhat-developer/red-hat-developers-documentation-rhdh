= New features

This section highlights new features in {product} {product-version}.

== Support for Role-Based Access Control 

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature in {product} introduces an administrator role and optimizes access control through organizational structures such as teams, groups, and users.

The RBAC features REST API endpoints that you can use to manage the permissions and roles in {product-short}.

Using the RBAC REST API, you can perform the following actions:
* Retrieve information about all permission policies or specific permission policies, or roles
* Create, update, or delete a permission policy or a role
* Retrieve permission policy information about static plugins

[NOTE]
====
RBAC is only supported on core {product} features including catalog, software templates, and RBAC plugin.
====

== Support for enabling plugins dynamically

The dynamic plugins feature enables you to sideload dynamic plugins into your {product-short} instance without having to recompile your code or rebuild the container.

{product-short} is pre-loaded with a selection of dynamic plugins. Most of these dynamic plugins are disabled by default due to the need for mandatory configuration. For a complete list of dynamic plugins that are included in this release of {product}, see the dynamic plugins matrix in the link:{LinkDebeziumUserGuide}#dynamic-plugins-matrix[Dynamic Plugins Matrix] section in the _Administration guide for {product}_.
