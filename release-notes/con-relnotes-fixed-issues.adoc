== Enhancements and bug fixes in {product} 1.1.0, 1.1.1, and 1.1.2

=== Enhancements and bug fixes in {product} 1.1.2

Impossible to use custom sidecar containers::
In earlier versions of {product-short}, you could not use sidecar containers by overriding the {product-short} image.
+
In {product} 1.1.2, you can now set the *RELATED_IMAGE_** environment variable or the `spec.application.image` field to override the {product-short} image.

Support for non-public images in a Kubernetes clulster::
In earlier versions of {product-short}, there was no option to configure image pull secrets for a PostgreSQL pod when installing {product} using the Operator.
+
Consequently, for a local PostgreSQL database, this issue prevented a user from using non-public images in non-OpenShift clusters such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
+
In {product} 1.1.2, you can configure the image pull secrets for both the {product-short} and PostgreSQL pods in `spec.application.imagePullSecrets`.

Cannot use the Helm CLI to install {product} 1.1.1::
After the (product-short) 1.1.0 release, OpenShift Helm charts were renamed which created an incompatibility issue with {product-short} 1.1.0 secrets naming conventions.
+
As a consequence, in {product-short} 1.1.1 the container fails to start if installed by the Helm CLI.
+
This regression issue which was introduced in {product-short} 1.1.1 is fixed in {product-short} 1.1.2. 

Operator pod may encounter an out of memory error::
In a cluster with a significant number of objects such as deployments and services, the {product-short} operator pod may fail and show an `OOMKilled` status, due to insufficient memory allocation..
+
In {product-short} 1.1.2, this issue is resolved by allocating additional memory to the pod.

=== Enhancements and bug fixes in {product} 1.1.1

ArgoCD plugin downgraded to 2.4.1 from 2.6.2::
The EntityArgoCDHistoryCard does not work when the ArgoCD backend plugin is used. This issue has been fixed by reverting the ArgoCD plugin version to 2.4.1. For more information, see https://github.com/RoadieHQ/roadie-backstage-plugins/issues/1238 

Helm Chart deployment issue::
In {product} 1.1.0, due to the inability to get resource "ingresses" in the config.openshift.io API group, a user without cluster administrator rights was unable to deploy the {product} 1.1.0 Helm Chart in hosted OpenShift Container Platform instances. This issue has been fixed by not automatically querying the OpenShift Container Platform cluster ingress for the domain to use for the `clusterRouterBase`, as regular users do not have access to this resource, only cluster admins.
+
As a result, when installing {product} using the 1.1.1 Helm Chart, you will need to set a `clusterRouterBase` value. For more details, see the link:{LinkAdminGuide}#proc-install-rhdh-helm_admin-rhdh[Installing {product} using Helm Chart] section of the _Administration guide for Red Hat Developer Hub_ guide for more details. 

RBAC Backend cleanup::
In {product-short} 1.1.0 when you remove all administration users from the application, administration metadata and policies are still present. This is issue is resolved in {product-short} 1.1.1 so that user data is removed correctly. For more information, see https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-plugins/pull/1314.

Tekton UI improvement::
The Roxctl image check sometimes does not contain the response in the expected format and causes the UI to break. This issue is fixed in {product} 1.1.1. For more information, see https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHTAPBUGS-1175 and https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-plugins/issues/1355.

Routes in the Toplogy view show an incorrect mapping::
In {product} 1.1.1. a check is added to services and routes to match the same namespace as workloads when resources are fetched across namespaces. For more information, see https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHTAPBUGS-1166 and https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-plugins/pull/1389.

Logout issue with OAuth2 Proxy (OIDC)::
In {product-short} 1.1.0 there is a sign-out issue for users that use OAuth2 Proxy with Keycloak. To resolve this sign-out issue, a forked version of auth-backend-module-oidc-provider is provided in 1.1.1 which enables switching to the OIDC provider with Keycloak. For more information, see https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHDHBUGS-11 and  https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-showcase/pull/1072.

=== Enhancements and bug fixes in {product} 1.1.0

Fix an inability to dynamically load several upstream backend plugins::
+
--
Before this release, a whole category of upstream or third-party backstage backend plugins could not be loaded dynamically when converted to dynamic plugins. Impacted plugins were those using the `resolvePackagePath()` backstage API method. This issue impacted most of the backend plugins using the database service and providing migration scripts.
This release removes such an important limitation of the dynamic plugin feature.
--

Incorrect configuration in the Atlassian Auth provider::
+
--
Before this release, the authorization URL was constructed as `${baseUrl}/oauth/authorize`, which did not align with the Atlassian expected path, resulting in an authentication error. Now, the users are directed to the authorization URL to get an authorization code for successful authentication.
--

RBAC: CSV repopulates the database whenever there is a server restart::
+
--
Before this release, the `policy.csv file` was used to load permissions into {product-short}. There might be instances of overlapping permissions, and the permissions could be reloaded into the database. 

--

Validation is not working for the `Create Role` API::
+
--
Before this release, the validation process in the `Create Role` API was ineffective, allowing the creation of roles that were invalid. This resulted in input errors when attempting to update or delete these roles. 

--

RBAC backend plugin: policy change requires server restart::
+
--
Before this release, manually manipulating the `policy.csv` file led to inconsistent behavior, causing the manipulated permission or role to not apply correctly within the RBAC plugin. 

--

No support for monitoring {product} plugins::
+
--
Before this release, no support was provided to administrators for monitoring {product} plugins. With this release, administrators can generate a list of {product-short} plugins and their versions for monitoring purposes. 

--
