=== Enabling Argo CD plugin

.Prerequisites

* Add Argo CD instance information to your `app-config.yaml` configmap as shown in the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
argocd:
  appLocatorMethods:
    - type: 'config'
      instances:
        - name: argoInstance1
          url: https://argoInstance1.com
          username: ${ARGOCD_USERNAME}
          password: ${ARGOCD_PASSWORD}
        - name: argoInstance2
          url: https://argoInstance2.com
          username: ${ARGOCD_USERNAME}
          password: ${ARGOCD_PASSWORD}
----

* Add the following annotation to the entity’s `catalog-info.yaml` file to identify the Argo CD applications.

+
[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  ...
  # The label that Argo CD uses to fetch all the applications. The format to be used is label.key=label.value. For example, rht-gitops.com/janus-argocd=quarkus-app.

  argocd/app-selector: '${ARGOCD_LABEL_SELECTOR}' 
----

* (Optional) Add the following annotation to the entity’s `catalog-info.yaml` file to switch between Argo CD instances as shown in the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
 annotations:
   ...
    # The Argo CD instance name used in `app-config.yaml`.

    argocd/instance-name: '${ARGOCD_INSTANCE}' 
----

+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not set this annotation, the Argo CD plugin defaults to the first Argo CD instance configured in `app-config.yaml`.
====

.Procedure

. Add the following to your dynamic-plugins ConfigMap to enable the Argo CD plugin.
+
