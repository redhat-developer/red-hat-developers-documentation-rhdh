= Topology

The Topology plugin enables you to visualize the workloads such as Deployment, Job, Daemonset, Statefulset, CronJob, and Pods powering any service on the Kubernetes cluster.

== For administrators

=== Installation

ifeval::[{doc-show-dynamic-content} == false]
The Red Hat Plug-ins for Backstage (RHPIB) packages are hosted in a separate NPM registry, which is maintained by Red Hat. To use these packages, you must adjust your NPM configuration to pull the `@redhat` scoped packages:

[source]
----
# update your .npmrc or .yarnrc file
yarn config set "@redhat:registry" https://npm.registry.redhat.com
# then pull a package 
yarn add @redhat/backstage-plugin-quay
----

For more information, see link:https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/npmrc[npm docs]. 

Creating a `.npmrc` file ensures that all the packages are scoped under `@redhat` and are fetched from link:https://npm.registry.redhat.com/[Red Hat's NPM registry], while the rest dependencies remain sourced from other link:registry.npmjs.org[registry].

Using this configuration, you can proceed with the installation of the individual packages.

.Prerequisites

* The Kubernetes plugins including `@backstage/plugin-kubernetes` and `@backstage/plugin-kubernetes-backend` are installed and configured by following the https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/installation[installation] and https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration[configuration] guides.
* The Kubernetes plugin is configured and connects to the cluster using a `ServiceAccount`.
* The https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#role-based-access-control[`ClusterRole`] must be granted to `ServiceAccount` accessing the cluster. If you have the {product-short} Kubernetes plugin configured, then the `ClusterRole` is already granted.
* The following must be added in``customResources`` component in the https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#configuring-kubernetes-clusters[`app-config.yaml`] file to view the OpenShift route:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
   kubernetes:
     ...
     customResources:
       - group: 'route.openshift.io'
         apiVersion: 'v1'
         plural: 'routes'
----

Also, ensure that the route is granted a https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#role-based-access-control[`ClusterRole`]. You can use the following code to grant the `ClusterRole` to the route :

[source,yaml]
----
    ...
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: backstage-read-only
    rules:
      ...
      - apiGroups:
          - route.openshift.io
        resources:
          - routes
        verbs:
          - get
          - list

----
--

* The following permission must be granted to the https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#role-based-access-control[`ClusterRole`] to be able to view the pod logs:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    name: backstage-read-only
  rules:
    ...
    - apiGroups:
        - ''
      resources:
        - pods
        - pods/log
      verbs:
        - get
        - list
        - watch
----
--

* The following code must be added in `customResources` component in the https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#configuring-kubernetes-clusters[`app-config.yaml`] file to view the Tekton PipelineRuns list in the side panel and to view the latest PipelineRun status in the Topology node decorator:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
  kubernetes:
    ...
    customResources:
      - group: 'tekton.dev'
        apiVersion: 'v1beta1'
        plural: 'pipelines'
      - group: 'tekton.dev'
        apiVersion: 'v1beta1'
        plural: 'pipelineruns'
      - group: 'tekton.dev'
        apiVersion: 'v1beta1'
        plural: 'taskruns'
----

Also, ensure that the Pipeline, PipelineRun, and TaskRun are granted a https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#role-based-access-control[`ClusterRole`]. You can use the following code to grant the `ClusterRole` to Pipeline, PipelineRun, and TaskRun:

[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    name: backstage-read-only
  rules:
    ...
    - apiGroups:
        - tekton.dev
      resources:
        - pipelines
        - pipelineruns
        - taskruns
      verbs:
        - get
        - list
----
--

* The following configuration must be added in`customResources` component in the https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#configuring-kubernetes-clusters[`app-config.yaml`] file to view the edit code decorator:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
  kubernetes:
    ...
    customResources:
      - group: 'org.eclipse.che'
        apiVersion: 'v2'
        plural: 'checlusters'
----

Also, ensure that the `CheCluster` is granted a https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#role-based-access-control[`ClusterRole`] as shown in the following example code:

[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    name: backstage-read-only
  rules:
    ...
    - apiGroups:
        - org.eclipse.che
      resources:
        - checlusters
      verbs:
        - get
        - list
----

* The following annotations are added to workload resources in the `deployment.yaml` file to navigate to the GitHub repository of the associated application using the edit code decorator:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  app.openshift.io/vcs-uri: <GIT_REPO_URL>
----

You can also add the following annotation to navigate to a specific branch:

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  app.openshift.io/vcs-ref: <GIT_REPO_BRANCH>
----

If Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces (RHODS) is installed and configured and Git URL annotations are also added in the workload YAML file, then clicking on the edit code decorator redirects you to the RHODS instance. For more information about installing RHODS, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_dev_spaces/3.7/html/administration_guide/installing-devspaces[Administration guide] of RHODS.

When you deploy your application using the OCP git import flow, then you do not need to add the labels as import flow to the workload YAML file. Otherwise, you would need to add the labels to the workload YAML file manually.

The labels are not similar to `backstage.io/edit-url` annotations as the added labels point to the source file of catalog entity metadata and is applied to {product-short} catalog entity metadata YAML file, but not to the Kubernetes resources.

You can also add the `app.openshift.io/edit-url` annotation that you want to access using the decorator.

[TIP]
====
You can use the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/backstage/community-plugins/main/workspaces/topology/plugins/topology/manifests/clusterrole.yaml[prepared manifest for a read-only `ClusterRole`], which provides access for both Kubernetes and Topology plugin.
====
--

* The following annotation is added to the entity's `catalog-info.yaml` file to identify whether an entity contains the Kubernetes resources:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  backstage.io/kubernetes-id: <BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME>
----

The following label is added to the resources so that the Kubernetes plugin receives the Kubernetes resources from the requested entity:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  backstage.io/kubernetes-id: <BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME>`
----

[NOTE]
====

When using the label selector, the mentioned labels must be present on the resource.
====
--

* The `backstage.io/kubernetes-namespace` annotation is added as follows to identify that the Kubernetes resources are using the defined namespace:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  backstage.io/kubernetes-namespace: <RESOURCE_NS>
----

If the `backstage.io/kubernetes-namespace` annotation is added to the `catalog-info.yaml` file, then the RHODS instance is not accessible using the edit code decorator.

To retrieve the instance URL, CheCluster Custom Resource (CR) is required. The instance URL is not retrieved if the namespace annotation value is different from `openshift-devspaces` as CheCluster CR is created in `openshift-devspaces` namespace.
--

* A custom label selector is added, which {product-short} uses to find the Kubernetes resources. The label selector takes precedence over the ID annotations. For example:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector: 'app=my-app,component=front-end'
----

If you have multiple entities while RHODS is configured and want multiple entities to support the edit code decorator that redirects to the RHODS instance, you can add the `backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector` annotation to the `catalog-info.yaml` file for each entity as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector: 'component in (<BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME>,che)'
----

If you are using the previous custom label selector, then make sure that you add the following labels to your resources so that the Kubernetes plugin receives the Kubernetes resources from the requested entity:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  component: che # add this label to your che cluster instance
----

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  component: <BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME> # add this label to the other resources associated with your entity
----

You can also write your own custom query for the label selector with unique labels to differentiate your entities. However, you need to ensure that you add those labels to the resources associated with your entities including your CheCluster instance.
--

* The following label is added to workload resources in the `deployment.yaml` file to display runtime icon in the topology nodes:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  app.openshift.io/runtime: <RUNTIME_NAME>
----

Alternatively, you can include the following label to display the runtime icon:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  app.kubernetes.io/name: <RUNTIME_NAME>
----

The `<RUNTIME_NAME>` parameter in the previous example label supports the following values:

* `django`
* `dotnet`
* `drupal`
* `go-gopher`
* `golang`
* `grails`
* `jboss`
* `jruby`
* `js`
* `nginx`
* `nodejs`
* `openjdk`
* `perl`
* `phalcon`
* `php`
* `python`
* `quarkus`
* `rails`
* `redis`
* `rh-spring-boot`
* `rust`
* `java`
* `rh-openjdk`
* `ruby`
* `spring`
* `spring-boot`

Any other value for `<RUNTIME_NAME>` parameter results in icons not being rendered for the node.
--

* The following label is added to display the workload resources such as Deployments and Pods in a visual group:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
  ```yaml title="catalog-info.yaml"
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: <GROUP_NAME>
  ```
----
--

* The following annotation is added to display the workload resources such as Deployments and Pods with a visual connector:
+
--
[source]
----
  ```yaml title="catalog-info.yaml"
  annotations:
    app.openshift.io/connects-to: '[{"apiVersion": <RESOURCE_APIVERSION>,"kind": <RESOURCE_KIND>,"name": <RESOURCE_NAME>}]'
  ```
----

== For users

=== Using the Topology plugin in {product-short}

Topology is a front-end plugin that enables you to view the workloads as nodes that power any service on the Kubernetes cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Your {product-short} application is installed and running.
* You have installed the Topology plugin. For the installation process, see <<Installation>>.

.Procedure

. Open your {product-short} application and select a component from the *Catalog* page.
. Go to the *TOPOLOGY* tab and you can view the workloads such as Deployments, Pods as nodes.
+
image::topology-tab-user1.png[topology-tab]

. Select a node and a pop-up appears on the right side, which contains two tabs: *Details* and *Resources*.
+
--
The *Details* and *Resources* tab contain the associated information and resources of the node.

image::topology-tab-user2.png[topology-tab-details]
--

. Click on the *Open URL* button on the top of a node.
+
--
