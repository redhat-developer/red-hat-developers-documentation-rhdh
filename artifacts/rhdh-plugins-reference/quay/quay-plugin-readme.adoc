The Red Hat Plug-ins for Backstage (RHPIB) packages are hosted in a separate NPM registry, which is maintained by Red Hat. To use these packages, you must adjust your NPM configuration to pull the `@redhat` scoped packages:

[source]
----
# update your .npmrc or .yarnrc file
yarn config set "@redhat:registry" https://npm.registry.redhat.com
# then pull a package 
yarn add @redhat/backstage-plugin-quay
----

For more information, see link:https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/npmrc[npm docs]. 

Creating a `.npmrc` file ensures that all the packages are scoped under `@redhat` and are fetched from link:https://npm.registry.redhat.com/[Red Hat's NPM registry], while the rest dependencies remain sourced from other link:registry.npmjs.org[registry].

You can now install the Quay plugin using the following command:

[source,console]
----
yarn workspace app add @redhat/backstage-plugin-quay
----
endif::[]


. Set the proxy to the desired Quay server in the `app-config.yaml` file as follows:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
   ```yaml title="app-config.yaml"
   proxy:
     '/quay/api':
       target: 'https://quay.io'
       headers:
         X-Requested-With: 'XMLHttpRequest'
         # Uncomment the following line to access a private Quay Repository using a token
         # Authorization: 'Bearer <YOUR TOKEN>'
       changeOrigin: true
       # Change to "false" in case of using self hosted quay instance with a self-signed certificate
       secure: true

   quay:
     # The UI url for Quay, used to generate the link to Quay
     uiUrl: 'https://quay.io'
   ```

. Enable an additional tab on the entity view page in `packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx`:
+
--
[source]
----
   ```tsx title="packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx"
   /* highlight-add-next-line */
   import { isQuayAvailable, QuayPage } from '@redhat/backstage-plugin-quay';

   const serviceEntityPage = (
     <EntityPageLayout>
       {/* ... */}
       {/* highlight-add-next-line */}
       <EntityLayout.Route if={isQuayAvailable} path="/quay" title="Quay">
         <QuayPage />
       </EntityLayout.Route>
     </EntityPageLayout>
   );
   ```
----
--
endif::[]

. Annotate your entity with the following annotations:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
   ```yaml title="catalog-info.yaml"
   metadata:
     annotations:
       'quay.io/repository-slug': `<ORGANIZATION>/<REPOSITORY>',
   ```

=== Using the Quay plugin in {product-short}

Quay is a front-end plugin that enables you to view the information about the container images.

.Prerequisites

* Your {product-short} application is installed and running.
* You have installed the Quay plugin. For installation process, see <<installation,Installation>>.

.Procedure

. Open your {product-short} application and select a component from the *Catalog* page.
. Go to the *Image Registry* tab.
+
The *Image Registry* tab in the {product-short} UI contains a list of container images and related information, such as *TAG*, *LAST MODIFIED*, *SECURITY SCAN*, *SIZE*, *EXPIRES*, and *MANIFEST*.
+
image::quay-plugin-backstage1.png[quay-tab]

. If a container image does not pass the security scan, select the security scan value of the image to check the vulnerabilities.
+
image::quay-plugin-backstage2.png[quay-tab]
+
The vulnerabilities page displays the associated advisory with a link, severity, package name, and current and fixed versions.
+
image::quay-plugin-backstage3.png[quay-tab-vulnerabilities]
+
The advisory link redirects to the Red Hat Security Advisory page that contains detailed information about the advisory, including the solution.
