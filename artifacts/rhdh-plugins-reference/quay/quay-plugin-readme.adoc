=== Installation

The Red Hat Plug-ins for Backstage (RHPIB) packages are hosted in a separate NPM registry, which is maintained by Red Hat. To use these packages, you must adjust your NPM configuration to pull the `@redhat` scoped packages:

[source]
----
# update your .npmrc or .yarnrc file
yarn config set "@redhat:registry" https://npm.registry.redhat.com
# then pull a package 
yarn add @redhat/backstage-plugin-quay
----

For more information, see link:https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/npmrc[npm docs]. 

Creating a `.npmrc` file ensures that all the packages are scoped under `@redhat` and are fetched from link:https://npm.registry.redhat.com/[Red Hat's NPM registry], while the rest dependencies remain sourced from other link:registry.npmjs.org[registry].

You can now install the Quay plugin using the following command:

[source,console]
----
yarn workspace app add @redhat/backstage-plugin-quay
----

=== Configuration

. Set the proxy to the desired Quay server in the `app-config.yaml` file as follows:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
   ```yaml title="app-config.yaml"
   proxy:
     '/quay/api':
       target: 'https://quay.io'
       headers:
         X-Requested-With: 'XMLHttpRequest'
         # Uncomment the following line to access a private Quay Repository using a token
         # Authorization: 'Bearer <YOUR TOKEN>'
       changeOrigin: true
       # Change to "false" in case of using self hosted quay instance with a self-signed certificate
       secure: true

   quay:
     # The UI url for Quay, used to generate the link to Quay
     uiUrl: 'https://quay.io'
   ```
----
--

. Enable an additional tab on the entity view page in `packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx`:
+
--
[source]
----
   ```tsx title="packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx"
   /* highlight-add-next-line */
   import { isQuayAvailable, QuayPage } from '@redhat/backstage-plugin-quay';

   const serviceEntityPage = (
     <EntityPageLayout>
       {/* ... */}
       {/* highlight-add-next-line */}
       <EntityLayout.Route if={isQuayAvailable} path="/quay" title="Quay">
         <QuayPage />
       </EntityLayout.Route>
     </EntityPageLayout>
   );
   ```
----
--

. Annotate your entity with the following annotations:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
   ```yaml title="catalog-info.yaml"
   metadata:
     annotations:
       'quay.io/repository-slug': `<ORGANIZATION>/<REPOSITORY>',
   ```
