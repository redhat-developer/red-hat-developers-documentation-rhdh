= Using Keycloak

The Keycloak backend plugin, which integrates Keycloak into {product-short}, has the following capabilities:

* Synchronization of Keycloak users in a realm.
* Synchronization of Keycloak groups and their users in a realm.

== Importing users and groups in {product-short} using the Keycloak plugin

After configuring the plugin successfully, the plugin imports the users and groups each time when started.

[NOTE]

If you set up a schedule, users and groups will also be imported.
