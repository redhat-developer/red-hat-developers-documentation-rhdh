= Installation and configuration of Keycloak 

The Keycloak backend plugin, which integrates Keycloak into {product-short}, has the following capabilities:

* Synchronization of Keycloak users in a realm.
* Synchronization of Keycloak groups and their users in a realm.

== For administrators

=== Installation

The Keycloak plugin is pre-loaded in {product-short} with basic configuration properties. To enable it, set the `disabled` property to `false` as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
global: 
  dynamic: 
    includes: 
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins: 
      - package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/janus-idp-backstage-plugin-keycloak-backend-dynamic
        disabled: false
----

=== Basic configuration
To enable the Keycloak plugin, you must set the following environment variables:

* `KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL`

* `KEYCLOAK_LOGIN_REALM`

* `KEYCLOAK_REALM`

* `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID`

* `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`

=== Advanced configuration

.Schedule configuration
You can configure a schedule in the `app-config.yaml` file, as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
     catalog:
       providers:
         keycloakOrg:
           default:
             # ...
             # highlight-add-start
             schedule: # optional; same options as in TaskScheduleDefinition
               # supports cron, ISO duration, "human duration" as used in code
               frequency: { minutes: 1 }
               # supports ISO duration, "human duration" as used in code
               timeout: { minutes: 1 }
               initialDelay: { seconds: 15 }
               # highlight-add-end
----

[NOTE]
====
If you have made any changes to the schedule in the `app-config.yaml` file, then restart to apply the changes.
====

.Keycloak query parameters

You can override the default Keycloak query parameters in the `app-config.yaml` file, as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
   catalog:
     providers:
       keycloakOrg:
         default:
           # ...
           # highlight-add-start
           userQuerySize: 500 # Optional
           groupQuerySize: 250 # Optional
           # highlight-add-end
----

Communication between {product-short} and Keycloak is enabled by using the Keycloak API. Username and password, or client credentials are supported authentication methods.


The following table describes the parameters that you can configure to enable the plugin under `catalog.providers.keycloakOrg.<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>` object in the `app-config.yaml` file:

|===
| Name | Description | Default Value | Required

| `baseUrl`
| Location of the Keycloak server, such as `pass:c[https://localhost:8443/auth]`. Note that the newer versions of Keycloak omit the `/auth` context path.
| ""
| Yes

| `realm`
| Realm to synchronize
| `master`
| No

| `loginRealm`
| Realm used to authenticate
| `master`
| No

| `username`
| Username to authenticate
| ""
| Yes if using password based authentication

| `password`
| Password to authenticate
| ""
| Yes if using password based authentication

| `clientId`
| Client ID to authenticate
| ""
| Yes if using client credentials based authentication

| `clientSecret`
| Client Secret to authenticate
| ""
| Yes if using client credentials based authentication

| `userQuerySize`
| Number of users to query at a time
| `100`
| No

| `groupQuerySize`
| Number of groups to query at a time
| `100`
| No
|===

When using client credentials, the access type must be set to `confidential` and service accounts must be enabled. You must also add the following roles from the `realm-management` client role:

* `query-groups`
* `query-users`
* `view-users`

=== Limitations

If you have self-signed or corporate certificate issues, you can set the following environment variable before starting {product-short}:

`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`


[NOTE]
====
The solution of setting the environment variable is not recommended.
====

== For users

=== Import of users and groups in {product-short} using the Keycloak plugin

After configuring the plugin successfully, the plugin imports the users and groups each time when started.

[NOTE]
====
If you set up a schedule, users and groups will also be imported.
====

After the first import is complete, you can select *User* to list the users from the catalog page:

image::rhdh-plugins-reference/users.jpg[catalog-list]

You can see the list of users on the page:

image::rhdh-plugins-reference/user-list.jpg[user-list]

When you select a user, you can see the information imported from Keycloak:

image::rhdh-plugins-reference/user2.jpg[user-profile]

You can also select a group, view the list, and select or view the information imported from Keycloak for a group:
