You can install {product} on {aks-brand-name} ({aks-short}) using one of the following methods:

* The {product} Operator
* The {product} Helm chart

[IMPORTANT]
====
Set the `baseUrl` in `{my-app-config-file}` to match the external URL of your {product-short} instance (for example, `https://rhdh.example.com`).
This value is required for the {product} to function correctly. If it is not set, frontend and backend services cannot communicate properly, and features may not work as expected.
