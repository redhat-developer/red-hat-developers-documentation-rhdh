You can install {product} on {ocp-short} by using one of the following installers:

The {product} Operator::
+
--
* Ready for immediate use in {ocp-short} after an administrator installs it with OperatorHub
* Uses Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM) to manage automated subscription updates on {ocp-short}
* Requires preinstallation of Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM) to manage automated subscription updates on Kubernetes
--

The {product} Helm chart::
+
--
* Ready for immediate use in both {ocp-short} and Kubernetes
* Requires manual installation and management
