You can install {product} on {ocp-short} by using one of the following installers:

The {product} Operator::
+
--
* Ready for immediate use in {ocp-short} after an administrator installs it with OperatorHub
* Uses Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM) to manage automated subscription updates on {ocp-short}
* Requires preinstallation of Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM) to manage automated subscription updates on Kubernetes
--

The {product} Helm chart::
+
--
* Ready for immediate use in both {ocp-short} and Kubernetes
* Requires manual installation and management
--

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must set the `baseUrl` in `{my-app-config-file}` to match the external URL of your {product-short} instance (for example, `pass:[https://rhdh.example.com]`).
This value is required for the {product} to function correctly. If it is not set, frontend and backend services cannot communicate properly, and features may not work as expected.
====

Use the installation method that best meets your needs and preferences.
