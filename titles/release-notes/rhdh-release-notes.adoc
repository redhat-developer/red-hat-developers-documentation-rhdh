== New features

[id="rhdh-relnotes-rbac"]
=== Support for Role-Based Access Control
The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature in Red Hat Developer Hub introduces an administrator role and optimizes access control through organizational structures such as teams, groups, and users.

The RBAC features REST API endpoints that you can use to manage the permissions and roles in the Developer Hub.

Using the RBAC REST API, you can perform the following actions:

* Retrieve information about all permission policies or specific permission policies, or roles.
* Create, update, or delete a permission policy or a role.
* Retrieve permission policy information about static plugins.

=== Limitations
RBAC is only supported on core Red Hat Developer Hub features such as the catalog, software templates, and the RBAC plugin itself.

[id="rhdh-relnotes-dynamic-plugins"]
=== Support for enabling plugins dynamically
The Dynamic Plugins feature enables you to sideload dynamic plugins into your RHDH instance without having to recompile your codebase or rebuild the container.

RHDH is pre-loaded with a selection of dynamic plugins. Most of these dynamic plugins are disabled by default due to the need for mandatory configuration. 

For a complete list of dynamic plugins that are included in this release of Red Hat Developer Hub, see the link:{LinkDebeziumUserGuide}#dynamic-plugins-matrix[Dynamic Plugins Matrix] section in the _Administration guide for Red Hat Developer Hub_.

== Known issues

[id="rbac-csv-repopulates-database"] 
.link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-852[RHIDP-850] - Issue 924: RBAC: CSV repopulates database whenever there is a server restart

There is a known issue with using the policy csv file to side load permissions into RHDH where there can be some overlap between permissions and permissions can be repopulated into the database. 
//Issue 924 Issue 776 

[id="validation-for-create-role-api"]
.link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-852[RHIDP-852] - Issue 943: Validation is not working for Create Role API
There is a known issue where the Create Role API validation is not properly working. This allows for the creation of roles that are invalid. The issue is that whenever those roles are updated or deleted, an input error will be thrown. 
//Issue 943 			

[id="rbac-policy-change"]
.link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-853[RHIDP-853] - Issue 908: RBAC backend plugin - policy change requires server restart
There is a known issue where manipulating the database manually will result in inconsistent behavior and the manipulated permission or role will not apply correctly within the RBAC plugin. 
//Issue 908 

[id="third-party-compatibility"]
.Third-party, user-added plugin compatibility
A third-party, user-added plugin added to Developer Hub could be updated without a necessary update to your Developer Hub instance which may cause a compatibility issue. Similarly, your Developer Hub instance could be updated which may also cause a compatibility issue with an existing third-party, user-added plugin.

=== Ability to deploy Developer Hub to Kubernetes using specific Helm Chart configuration
To deploy the Helm Chart on vanilla Kubernetes or other non-OCP platform, you must apply the following configuration to the values.yaml file:

[source,java,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
global:
    host: # Specify your own Ingress host
route:
    enabled: false  # OpenShift Routes do not exist on vanilla Kubernetes
upstream:
    ingress:
    enabled: true  # Use Kubernetes Ingress instead of OpenShift Route
    backstage:
    podSecurityContext:  # Vanilla Kubernetes does not feature OpenShift default SCCs with dynamic UIDs, adjust accordingly to the deployed image
        runAsUser: 1001
        runAsGroup: 1001
        fsGroup: 1001
    postgresql:
    primary:
        podSecurityContext:
