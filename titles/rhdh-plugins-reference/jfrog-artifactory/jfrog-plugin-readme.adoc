== For administrators

=== Installing and configuring the Jfrog Artifactory plugin

The Red Hat Plug-ins for Backstage (RHPIB) packages are hosted in a separate NPM registry, which is maintained by Red Hat. To use these packages, you must adjust your NPM configuration to pull the `@redhat` scoped packages:

[source]
----
# update your .npmrc or .yarnrc file
yarn config set "@redhat:registry" https://npm.registry.redhat.com
# then pull a package 
yarn add @redhat/backstage-plugin-quay
----

For more information, see link:https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/npmrc[npm docs]. 

Creating a `.npmrc` file ensures that all the packages are scoped under `@redhat` and are fetched from link:https://npm.registry.redhat.com/[Red Hat's NPM registry], while the rest dependencies remain sourced from other link:registry.npmjs.org[registry].

.Procedure
