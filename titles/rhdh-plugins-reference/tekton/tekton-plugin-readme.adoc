= Installation and configuration of Tekton

You can use the Tekton plugin to visualize the results of CI/CD pipeline runs on your Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters. The plugin allows users to visually see high level status of all associated tasks in the pipeline for their applications.

=== Installation

.Prerequsites
* You have installed and configured the `@backstage/plugin-kubernetes` and `@backstage/plugin-kubernetes-backend` dynamic plugins. For more information about installing dynamic plugins, see xref:rhdh-installing-dynamic-plugins[Installing dynamic plugins].

* The Kubernetes plugin is configured and connects to the cluster using a `ServiceAccount`. 

* The `ClusterRole` must be granted for custom resources (PipelineRuns and TaskRuns) to the `ServiceAccount` accessing the cluster.

* To view the pod logs, you have granted permissions for `pods/log`.

* If you have the RHDH Kubernetes Plugin configured, then the `ClusterRole` is already granted.

* You can use the following code to grant the `ClusterRole` for custom resources and pod logs:

You can use the prepared manifest for a read-only `ClusterRole`, which provides access for both Kubernetes plugin and Tekton plugin.

The following annotation is added to the entity's `catalog-info.yaml` file to identify whether an entity contains the Kubernetes resources:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  ...

  backstage.io/kubernetes-id: <BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME>
----

* You can also add the `backstage.io/kubernetes-namespace` annotation to identify the Kubernetes resources using the defined namespace.

[source,yaml]

annotations:
  ...

  backstage.io/kubernetes-namespace: <RESOURCE_NS>

* The following annotation is added to the `catalog-info.yaml` file of the entity to enable the Tekton related features in RHDH. The value of the annotation identifies the name of the RHDH entity:

annotations:
  ...

  janus-idp.io/tekton : <BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME>
----

* A custom label selector can be added, which RHDH uses to find the Kubernetes resources. The label selector takes precedence over the ID annotations.
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  ...

  backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector: 'app=my-app,component=front-end'

* The following label is added to the resources so that the Kubernetes plugin gets the Kubernetes resources from the requested entity:

[NOTE]
When using the label selector, the mentioned labels must be present on the resource.


The Red Hat Plug-ins for Backstage (RHPIB) packages are hosted in a separate NPM registry, which is maintained by Red Hat. To use these packages, you must adjust your NPM configuration to pull the `@redhat` scoped packages:

[source]
----
# update your .npmrc or .yarnrc file
yarn config set "@redhat:registry" https://npm.registry.redhat.com
# then pull a package 
yarn add @redhat/backstage-plugin-quay
----

For more information, see link:https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/npmrc[npm docs]. 

Creating a `.npmrc` file ensures that all the packages are scoped under `@redhat` and are fetched from link:https://npm.registry.redhat.com/[Red Hat's NPM registry], while the rest dependencies remain sourced from other link:registry.npmjs.org[registry].

Using this configuration, you can proceed with the installation of the individual packages.

.Prerequisites

* The Kubernetes plugins including `@backstage/plugin-kubernetes` and `@backstage/plugin-kubernetes-backend` are installed and configured by following the https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/installation[installation] and https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration[configuration] guides.
* The following `customResources` component is added in the https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#configuring-kubernetes-clusters[`app-config.yaml`] file:

== For users

[[using-tekton-plugin]]
=== Using the Tekton plugin in RHDH
Tekton is a front-end plugin that enables you to view the `PipelineRun` resources. 

.Prerequisites
* Your RHDH application is installed and running. 							
* You have installed the Tekton plugin. For the installation process, see xref:installation-and-configuration-tekton[Installing and configuring the Tekton plugin].

.Procedure
* Open your RHDH application and select a component from the *Catalog* page. 							
* Go to the *CI* tab. 	
+						
The *CI* tab displays the list of PipelineRun resources associated with a Kubernetes cluster. The list contains pipeline run details, such as *NAME*, *STATUS*, *TASK STATUS*, *STARTED*, and *DURATION*.
+

* Click on the expand row button besides PipelineRun name in the list to view the PipelineRun visualization. The pipeline run resource includes tasks to complete. When you hover the mouse pointer on a task card, you can view the steps to complete that particular task.
