  # /!\ Warning: using the pull_request_target event to be able to read secrets. But using this event without the cautionary measures described below
  # may allow unauthorized GitHub users to open a “pwn request” and exfiltrate secrets.
  # As recommended in https://iterative.ai/blog/testing-external-contributions-using-github-actions-secrets,
  # we are adding an 'authorize' job that checks if the workflow was triggered from a fork PR. In that case, the "external" environment
  # will prevent the job from running until it's approved manually by human intervention.
