## Building locally

. Install `asciidoctor` - see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/linux-packaging/
. Install Podman - see https://podman.io.
. Run the following command to generate html with images in titles-generated/ folders by using `ccutil` in a container.
The `ccutil` CLI tool reproduces the behavior of the production publication chain (Pantheon), including its limitations, and is therefore preferred over using a more recent `asciidoctor` CLI version.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  build/scripts/build-ccutil.sh
----

[NOTE]
====
* To build with `asciidoctor` rather than `ccutil`, run the following script.
The output will look differently and you might miss issues with content that cannot build in production.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  build/scripts/build.sh
