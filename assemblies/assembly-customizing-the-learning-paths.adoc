= Customizing the Learning Paths in {product}

In {product}, you can configure Learning Paths by hosting the required data externally,
and using the built-in proxy to deliver this data rather than the default.

You can provide Learning Paths data from the following sources:

* A JSON file hosted on a web server, such as GitHub or GitLab.
* A dedicated service that provides the Learning Paths data in JSON format using an API.
