A template is a form composed of different UI fields that is defined in a YAML file. Templates include _actions_, which are steps that are executed in sequential order and can be executed conditionally.

You can use templates to easily create {product} components, and then publish these components to different locations, such as the {product} software catalog, or repositories in GitHub or GitLab.
