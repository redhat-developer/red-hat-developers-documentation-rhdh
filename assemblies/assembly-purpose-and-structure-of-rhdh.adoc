= Purpose and structure of {product}

To streamline your software development lifecycle, your organization has chosen to use {product} ({product-very-short}) as your primary internal developer portal (IDP). 

{product-very-short} offers a unified interface to manage infrastructure, generate software projects, use tools and services, and access technical documentation in a centralized location.

The developer experience challenge::
Modern software development often involves fragmented workflows. Developers frequently switch contexts between code repositories, ticketing systems, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring dashboards, and so on. This fragmentation creates information silos and increases the time required to find API documentation, service ownership details, or deployment status.

Improving developer productivity with {product-very-short}::
{product-very-short} centralizes fragmented technical resources to streamline the developer experience. The platform provides the following advantages:

* *Unified discovery:* Locate applications, APIs, and documentation in a single, accessible location.
* *Search capabilities*: Find users, groups, and catalog using an integrated search feature. Once indexed, all entities become discoverable across the entire ecosystem within seconds.
* *Self-service capabilities:* Create projects and deploy services using automated Software Templates. This ensures consistency and reduces reliance on manual ticketing.
* *Service visibility:* Map relationships between services, dependencies, and API contracts to clarify ownership and component linkages.
* *Extensibility:* Integrate external tools, such as monitoring dashboards and pipelines, directly into the portal to create a unified interface.
