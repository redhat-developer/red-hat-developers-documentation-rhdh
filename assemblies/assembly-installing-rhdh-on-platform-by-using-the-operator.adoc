= Installing {product-short} on {platform-long} by using the Operator

To benefit from over-the-air updates and catalogs provided by Operator-based applications distributed with the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) framework, consider installing {product} by using the {product} Operator distributed in the {company-name} Ecosystem.

On {platform}, the most notable differences over an OpenShift-based installation are:

* The OLM framework and the {company-name} Ecosystem are not built-in.
* The {company-name} Ecosystem pull-secret is not managed globally.
* To expose the application, Ingresses replace OpenShift Routes.

For clarity, the content is broken down in sections highlighting these platform-specific additional steps.
