= Managing role-based access controls (RBAC) using the {product} Web UI

Policy administrators can use the {product-short} web interface (Web UI) to allocate specific roles and permissions to individual users or groups. Allocating roles ensures that access to resources and functionalities is regulated across the {product-short}.

With the policy administrator role in {product-short}, you can assign permissions to users and groups, which allow users or groups to view, create, modify, and delete the roles using the {product-short} Web UI.
