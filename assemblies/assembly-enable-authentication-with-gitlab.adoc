= Enable authentication with GitLab

You can enable authentication with GitLab to allow users to sign in to {product-short} using their GitLab credentials.

This integration also allows you to provision user and group data from GitLab to the {product-short} software catalog, enabling features that rely on synchronized user and group data.

If the default provisioning options do not meet your needs, you can create a custom transformer to provision user and group data from GitLab to the software catalog.
