= Importing and using an existing Software Template for faster development

You can configure Software Templates to create software components and publish these components to Git repositories.
Once the components are published to Git repositories, register these components in the Software Catalog.

A template is a form composed of different UI fields that is defined in a YAML file.
Software Templates include _actions_, which are steps that are executed in sequential order and can be executed conditionally.
