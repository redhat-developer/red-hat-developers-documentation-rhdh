= Find software components using the Software Catalog

When you need to integrate with existing software in {product} ({product-very-short}), verify ownership, or check if a solution already exists, you can browse the Software Catalog. The catalog acts as a centralized inventory of your organization's software ecosystem, allowing you to discover assets without hunting through scattered documentation or repositories.
The catalog helps you achieve the following outcomes:

* Reuse existing code: Discover shared libraries and components to avoid duplication.
* Understand dependencies: Visualize how services and APIs connect to one another.
* Identify ownership: Quickly find the team or individual responsible for a specific asset.
