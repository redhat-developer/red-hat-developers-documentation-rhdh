= Import and use an existing Software Template for faster development

To standardize and accelerate the creation of new software, use Software Templates in {product} ({product-very-short}). You can generate consistent software components, publish them to Git repositories, and register them in the Software Catalog to make sure they are discoverable across your organization.

Each template uses a YAML definition to present a functional interface for inputting project metadata. Software Templates run a sequential series of _actions_, such as scaffolding code or creating repositories, which you can configure to run conditionally based on user input.
