= Running {product} behind a corporate proxy

In a network restricted environment, configure {product} to use your proxy to access remote network resources.

You can run the {product-very-short} application behind a corporate proxy by setting any of the following environment variables before starting the application:

* `HTTP_PROXY`: Denotes the proxy to use for HTTP requests.
* `HTTPS_PROXY`: Denotes the proxy to use for HTTPS requests.

Additionally, set the `NO_PROXY` environment variable to bypass the proxy for certain domains. The variable value is a comma-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses that can be accessed without the proxy, even if one is specified.
