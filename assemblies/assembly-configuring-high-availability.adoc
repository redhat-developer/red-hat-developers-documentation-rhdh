= Configuring High Availability in {product}

As an administrator, you can configure High Availability in {product}. Once you set the High Availability option in {product-short}, the {ocp-brand-name} built-in Load Balancer manages the ingress traffic and distributes the load to each pod. The {product-very-short} backend also manages concurrent requests or conflicts on the same resource. 

You can configure High Availability in {product-very-short} by modifying the `replicas` value in your `{product-custom-resource-type}` custom resource (CR) using any of the following methods:

* The {product} Operator
* The {product} Helm chart
