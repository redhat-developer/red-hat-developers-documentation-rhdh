= Removing a TechDocs add-on

Administrators can remove installed TechDocs add-ons from your {product} instance by using either the Operator or Helm chart, depending on the method used to install the add-on. If you used the Operator to install the add-on, remove it from the ConfigMap. If you used the Helm chart to install the add-on, remove it from the Helm chart.

If you want to disable a plugin instead of removing it from your {product} instance, you can disable the plugin that you are using to import the TechDocs add-on. Since the `disabled` status is controlled at the plugin level, disabling the plugin disables all of the TechDocs add-ons in the specified plugin package.
