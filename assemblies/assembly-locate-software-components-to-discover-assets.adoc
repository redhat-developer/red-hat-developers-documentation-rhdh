= Locate software components to discover assets

To integrate with existing software, verify ownership, or prevent redundant development, use the Software Catalog in {product} ({product-very-short}). This centralized inventory of your organization's software ecosystem helps you discover assets without searching through disparate documentation or repositories.

By using the Software Catalog, you can achieve the following outcomes:

* Reuse existing code: Locate shared libraries and components to prevent duplication of effort.
* Understand dependencies: Visualize connections between services and API contracts.
* Identify ownership: Find the specific team or individual responsible for an asset to facilitate collaboration.
