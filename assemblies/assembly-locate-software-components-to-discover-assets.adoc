= Locate software components to discover assets

To integrate with existing software, verify ownership, or prevent redundant development, use the Software Catalog in {product} ({product-very-short}). You can use this centralized inventory to discover assets without searching through multiple documentation sources or repositories.

By using the Software Catalog, you can achieve the following outcomes:

* Reuse existing code: Locate shared libraries and components to prevent duplication of effort.
* Understand dependencies: Visualize connections between services and API contracts.
* Identify ownership: Find the specific team or individual responsible for an asset to facilitate collaboration.

[NOTE]
====
As an {product-very-short} user, your administrator might allow you to also add the products you are working on to this catalog. Reach out to your administrator for more information.
