= Disabling telemetry data collection in {product-very-short}

To disable telemetry data collection, you must disable the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin either using the Helm Chart or the {product} Operator configuration.

As an administrator, you can disable the telemetry data collection feature based on your needs. For example, in an air-gapped environment, you can disable this feature to avoid needless outbound requests affecting the responsiveness of the {product-very-short} application.
