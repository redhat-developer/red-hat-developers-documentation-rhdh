= Enabling authentication in {product}

Depending on your organization's security policies, you might require to identify and authorize users before giving them access to resources, such as {product}.

In {product-short}, authentication and authorization are two separate processes:

. Authentication defines the user identity, and passes on this information to {product-short}.
Read the following chapters to configure authentication in {product-short}.

. Authorization defines what the authenticated identity can access or do in {product-short}.
See link:{authorization-book-url}[{authorization-book-title}].

[TIP]
.Not recommended for production
====
To explore {product-short} features, you can enable the guest user to skip configuring authentication and authorization, log in as the guest user, and access all the features.
====

The authentication system in {product-short} is handled by external authentication providers.

{product-short} supports following authentication providers:

* Red Hat Single-Sign On (RHSSO)
* GitHub
* Microsoft Azure

To identify users in {product-short}, configure:

* One (and only one) authentication provider for sign-in and identification.
* Optionally, additional authentication providers for identification, to add more information to the user identity, or enable access to additional external resources.

For each authentication provider, set up the shared secret that the authentication provider and {product-short} require to communicate, first in the authentication provider, then in {product-short}.

{product-short} stores user identity information in the {product-short} software catalog.

[TIP]
.Not recommended for production
====
To explore the authentication system and use {product-short} without authorization policies, you can bypass the {product-short} software catalog and start using {product-short} without provisioning the {product-short} software catalog.
====

To get, store, and update additional user information, such as group or team ownership, with the intention to use this data to define authorization policies, provision users and groups in the {product-short} software catalog.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-short} uses a one-way synchronization system to provision users and groups from your authentication system to the {product-short} software catalog.
Therefore, deleting users and groups by using {product-short} Web UI or REST API might have unintended consequences.
