= Enable authentication in {product} (with mandatory steps only)

[role="_abstract"]
You can enable authentication in {product} to allow users to sign in to {product} using credentials from an external identity provider, such as {rhbk}, GitHub, or {azure-brand-name}.
This integration also allows you to provision user and group data from the identity provider to the {product-short} software catalog, enabling features that rely on synchronized user and group data.
