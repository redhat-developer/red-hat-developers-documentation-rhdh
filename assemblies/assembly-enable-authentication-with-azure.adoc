= Enable authentication with {azure-brand-name}

[role="_abstract"]
You can enable authentication with {azure-brand-name} to allow users to sign in to {product-short} using their {azure-brand-name} credentials.
This integration also allows you to provision user and group data from {azure-brand-name} to the {product-short} software catalog, enabling features that rely on synchronized user and group data.
If the default provisioning options do not meet your needs, you can also create a custom transformer to provision user and group data from {azure-brand-name} to the software catalog.
