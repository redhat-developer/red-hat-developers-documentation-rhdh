= Monitoring with Amazon Prometheus

{product} provides Prometheus metrics related to the running application. For more information about enabling or deploying Prometheus for EKS clusters, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/prometheus.html[Prometheus metrics] in the Amazon documentation.

To monitor {product-short} using https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/[Amazon-managed Prometheus], you need to create an Amazon managed service for the Prometheus workspace and configure the ingestion of the Developer Hub Prometheus metrics. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-onboard-create-workspace.html[Create a workspace] and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-onboard-ingest-metrics.html[Ingest Prometheus metrics to the workspace] sections in the Amazon documentation.

After ingesting Prometheus metrics into the created workspace, you can configure the metrics scraping to extract data from pods based on specific pod annotations.
