= Configuring a floating action button in {product}

You can use the floating action button plugin to configure any action button as a floating button in any page in the {product-short} instance as you want. The floating action button plugin is enabled by default. You can also configure floating action buttons to display as submenu options within the main floating action button by assigning the floating action buttons to the same slot.
