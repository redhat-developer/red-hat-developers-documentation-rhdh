= Configuring a floating action button in {product}

As a {product-short} administrator, you can use the floating action button to configure any action button as a floating button in any page in the {product-short} instance as you want. The floating action button is preinstalled on a {product-short} instance and disabled by default. You can also configure floating action buttons to display as submenu options within the main floating action button.
