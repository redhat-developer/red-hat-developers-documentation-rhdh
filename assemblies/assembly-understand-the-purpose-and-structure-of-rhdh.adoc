= Understand the purpose and structure of {product}

To streamline your software development lifecycle, use {product} ({product-very-short}) as your primary internal developer portal (IDP). 

You can access a unified interface to manage infrastructure, tools, services, and technical documentation in a centralized location.

The developer experience challenge::
Modern software development often involves fragmented workflows. Developers frequently switch contexts between code repositories, ticketing systems, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring dashboards. This fragmentation creates information silos and increases the time required to find API documentation, service ownership details, or deployment status.

The {product-very-short} solution::
{product-very-short} addresses these challenges by consolidating resources into a single, searchable portal. This centralization offers the following advantages:

* *Unified discovery:* Users can locate applications, APIs, and documentation in one location.
* *Self-service capabilities:* Developers can create projects and deploy services using automated templates, reducing reliance on manual ticketing.
* *Service visibility:* The platform maps relationships between services, dependencies, and API contracts.
* *Extensibility:* Users can integrate external tools, such as monitoring dashboards and pipelines, directly into the interface.
