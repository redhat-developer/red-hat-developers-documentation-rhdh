= Understand the purpose and structure of {product}

{product} ({product-very-short}) is an internal developer portal (IDP) designed to streamline the software development lifecycle. Built on the open source CNCF Backstage project, RHDH provides a unified interface that centralizes infrastructure, tools, services, and documentation.

.The developer experience challenge

Modern software development often involves fragmented workflows. Developers frequently switch contexts between code repositories, ticketing systems, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring dashboards. This fragmentation creates information silos and increases the time required to find API documentation, service ownership details, or deployment status.

.The {product-very-short} solution

{product-very-short} addresses these challenges by consolidating resources into a single, searchable portal. This centralization offers the following advantages:

* *Unified discovery:* Users can locate applications, APIs, and documentation in one location.
* *Self-service capabilities:* Developers can create projects and deploy services using automated templates, reducing reliance on manual ticketing.
* *Service visibility:* The platform maps relationships between services, dependencies, and API contracts.
* *Extensibility:* Users can integrate external tools, such as monitoring dashboards and pipelines, directly into the interface.
