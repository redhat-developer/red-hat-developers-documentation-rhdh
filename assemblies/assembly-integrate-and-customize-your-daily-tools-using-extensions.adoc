= Integrate and customize your daily tools using extensions

To integrate your development toolchain into a single interface and customize your experience, use the extensions and plugins in {product} {product-very-short}. While core features such as the Software Catalog and TechDocs are pre-installed, you can add plugins to interact with external services like Jira, Jenkins, or ArgoCD. By discovering global features in the navigation sidebar or reviewing entity-specific data in the catalog, you extend portal capabilities and access information from your daily tools directly within the portal.
