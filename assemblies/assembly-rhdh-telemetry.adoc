= Telemetry data collection and analysis

The telemetry data collection feature helps in collecting and analyzing the telemetry data to improve your experience with {product}. This feature is enabled by default.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As an administrator, you can disable the telemetry data collection feature based on your needs. For example, in an air-gapped environment, you can disable this feature to avoid needless outbound requests affecting the responsiveness of the {product-very-short} application. For more details, see the link:{telemetry-data-collection-book-url}#proc-disabling-telemetry-using-operator_title-telemetry[Disabling telemetry data collection in {product-very-short}] section.

{company-name} collects and analyzes the following data:

*Web Analytics (Segment)*

Web Analytics tracks user behavior and interactions with {product}. Specifically, it tracks the following:

* Events of page visits and clicks on links or buttons.
* System-related information, for example, locale, time zone, user agent including browser and OS details.
* Page-related information, for example, title, category, extension name, URL, path, referrer, and search parameters.
* Anonymized IP addresses, recorded as `0.0.0.0`.
* Anonymized username hashes, which are unique identifiers used solely to identify the number of unique users of the {product-very-short} application.

*System Observability (OpenTelemetry)*

System Observability tracks the performance of the {product-very-short}. Specifically, it tracks the following metrics:

* Key system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and other performance indicators.
* Information about system components, such as the locale, timezone, and user agent (including details of the browser and operating system).
* Traces and logs monitor system processes, allowing you to troubleshoot potential issues impacting the performance of {product-very-short}.

With {product-very-short}, you can customize the _Web Analytics_ and _System Observability_ configuration based on your needs.
