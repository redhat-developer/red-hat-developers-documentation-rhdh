= Telemetry data collection

You can use the telemetry data collection feature by configuring the `janus-idp
-backstage-plugin-analytics-provider-segment` plugin. Based on the data collected, {company-name} analyzes your usage of the {product} application. This analysis helps in providing you support for upgrades, optimizing performance or configuration, minimizing service impacts, identifying and remediating threats, troubleshooting, improving the offerings and your experience, and responding to your issues. 

This feature collects the following data about your {product-very-short} usage:

* Events-related information, for example,  number of page visits, number of clicks on any links or buttons.
* IP address-related information. The IP addresses are anonymized and recorded as `0.0.0.0`.
* Username-related information. The usernames are recorded as an anonymized hash ID.   
* User-related information, for example, locale, timezone, user agent including browser and OS details.
* Page-related information, for example, title, category, extension name, URL, path, referrer, and search parameters.

{company-name} analyzes the collected data to understand your interactions with the {product-very-short} application without disclosing your identity and compromising your privacy. {company-name} uses the collected data only for internal analysis and to improve your experience with {product}.

With {product-very-short}, you can customize the telemetry data collection feature and the telemetry destination configuration based on your needs.
