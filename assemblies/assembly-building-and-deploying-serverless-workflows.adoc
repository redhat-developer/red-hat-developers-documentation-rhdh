= Build and deploy serverless workflows

To deploy a workflow and make it available in the Orchestrator plugin, follow these main steps:

* Building workflow images
* Generating workflow manifests
* Deploying workflows to a cluster

This process moves the workflow from your local machine to deployment on a cluster.
