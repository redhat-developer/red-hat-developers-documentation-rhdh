= Enabling the Microsoft Azure authentication provider

{product} includes a Microsoft Azure authentication provider that can authenticate users by using OAuth.

.Procedure
. To allow {product-short} to authenticate with Microsoft Azure, create an OAuth Application in Microsoft Azure.

.. Go to link:https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade[*Azure Portal > App registrations*], and create an *App Registration* for {product-short}.

.. On your *App registration* overview page, add a new *Web platform configuration*, with the configuration:

*Redirect URI*:: Enter the backend authentication URI set in {product-short}: `pass:c,a,q[http://_<APP_FQDN>_/api/auth/microsoft/handler/frame]`
*Front-channel logout URL*:: Leave blank.
*Implicit grant and hybrid flows*:: Leave all checkboxes cleared.

.. On the *API permissions* tab, click *Add Permission*, then add the following *Delegated permission* for the
*Microsoft Graph API*:

`email`:::
`offline_access`:::
`openid`:::
`profile`:::
`User.Read`:::
(Optionally)::: Optional custom scopes of the Microsoft Graph API that you define also in the {product-short} configuration (`app-config-rhdh.yaml`).

.. (Optionally) Your company might require you to grant admin consent for these permissions.
Even if your company does not require link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/user-admin-consent-overview[admin consent], you might do so as it means users do not need to individually consent the first time they access backstage.
To grant admin consent, a directory admin must go to this page and click the *Grant admin consent for COMPANY NAME* button.

.. Go to the *Certificates & Secrets* page, then the *Client secrets* tab, and create a new client secret.
Save the *Client secret* for the next step.

. Add your Gitlab credentials in your {product-short} secrets.
+
Edit your {product-short} secrets, such as `secrets-rhdh`.
+
Add the following key/value pairs:
+
`AUTH_AZURE_CLIENT_ID`:: Enter the *Application ID* that you generated on Microsoft Azure.
`AUTH_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`:: Enter the *Client secret* that you generated on Microsoft Azure.
`AUTH_AZURE_TENANT_ID`:: Enter your *Tenant ID* on Microsoft Azure.

. Set up the Gitlab authentication provider in your {product-short} custom configuration.
+
Edit your custom {product-short} config map, such as `app-config-rhdh`.
+
In the `app-config-rhdh.yaml` content, add the `microsoft` provider configuration under the root `auth` configuration, and enable the `microsoft` provider for sign-in:
+
.`app-config-rhdh.yaml` fragment

<1> Optionally, when your application is not multi tenant,
to reduce login friction for users with accounts in multiple tenants
by automatically filtering away accounts from other tenants:
uncomment, and enter the tenant id.
Typically, the same as `tenantId`.
Leave blank if your app registration is multi tenant.
See link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/home-realm-discovery-policy[Home Realm Discovery].
<2> Optionally, to add scopes for the App Registration: uncomment and enter the scopes list.
The default and mandatory value is `['user.read']`.
<3> To enable the Microsoft Azure provider as default sign-in provider.

. Optionally, when your environment has restrictions on outgoing access, for instance through firewall rules, make sure your Backstage backend has access to the following hosts:

`login.microsoftonline.com`:: To get and exchange authorization codes and access tokens.

`graph.microsoft.com`:: To fetch user profile information (as seen in this source code).
If this host is unreachable, users might see an _Authentication failed, failed to fetch user profile_ error when they attempt to log in.
