= Managing starred items for quick access

To streamline your daily workflow and reduce navigation time, use the starring feature in {product} ({product-very-short}). By starring key components, APIs, and services in the Software Catalog, you create a personalized list of high-priority resources accessible directly from your sidebar or homepage.

This personalization makes sure that you can locate the specific tools and documentation you use most frequently without performing repetitive searches across the software ecosystem.
