= Get AI-assisted help for your development tasks

To assist with development tasks, platform questions, and debugging, use {ls-brand-name}, a generative AI virtual assistant integrated directly into {product} ({product-very-short}). You can use the conversational interface to ask platform-specific questions, analyze logs, generate code, and create test plans, which reduces the time spent searching through official documentation or disparate tools.
