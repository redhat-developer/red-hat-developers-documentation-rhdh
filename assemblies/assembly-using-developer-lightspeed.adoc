= Get AI-assisted help for your development tasks

To assist with development tasks, platform questions, and debugging, use {ls-brand-name}, a generative AI virtual assistant integrated directly into {product} ({product-very-short}). You can use the conversational interface to ask platform-specific questions, analyze logs, generate code, and create test plans, which reduces the time spent searching through official documentation or disparate tools.

.Capabilities
The scope of questions you can ask depends on your configuration:

* *Question Validation* enabled (default): Supports general questions about {product}. For example:

** “Tell me about {product}.”
** “What are the benefits of {product-very-short}?”
** “Can I use {product-very-short} on an {ocp-short}?”
** “How do I install plugins on {product}?”

* *Question Validation* disabled: Supports broader tasks such as log analysis, code generation, and creating Kubernetes deployments. For example:

** “Analyze this log for me…”
** “Suggest libraries and frameworks I can use to build Event Driven Architecture microservices.”
** “I'm not familiar with this language, so explain to me what this code snippet is doing…”
** “Create a Kubernetes deployment for this service…”
** “Create a test plan for the following scenarios and conditions…”
** “Create a Jira record that describes the following feature…”
** “Draft the end-user documentation describing how to use the following cli command…”

[NOTE]
====
The `Question Validation` feature is enabled by default if you are using the `quay.io/redhat-ai-dev/llama-stack` image without overriding the `run.yaml` configuration file in the image. To disable `Question Validation`, you must mount a `run.yaml` file to the container with the following sections removed:

* `Safety`
* `Shields`
* `External_providers_dir` set to `null` 
====

.Prerequisites

* Your platform engineer has installed and configured the {ls-short} plugin in your {product-very-short} instance.
