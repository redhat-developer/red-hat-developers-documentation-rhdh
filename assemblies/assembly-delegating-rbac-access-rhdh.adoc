= Delegating role-based access controls (RBAC) access in {product}

An enterprise customer requires the ability to delegate role-based access control (RBAC) responsibilities to other individuals in the organization. In this scenario, you, as the administrator, can provide access to the RBAC plugin specifically to designated users, such as team leads. Each team lead is then able to manage permissions exclusively for users within their respective team or department, without visibility into or control over permissions outside their assigned scope. This approach allows team leads to manage access and permissions for their own teams independently, while administrators maintain global oversight.

In {product}, you can delegate RBAC access using the multitenancy feature of the RBAC plugin, specifically the `IS_OWNER` conditional rule. You can either use the web UI or the RBAC backend API, depending on your preferred workflow and level of automation:

* Use the web UI to create roles, assign users or groups, define permissions, and apply ownership conditions through an intuitive interface.

* Use the API for a more flexible and automatable approach, where you can programmatically manage roles, permissions, and ownership conditions using authenticated curl requests.

By delegating RBAC access through either method, you can expect the following outcomes:

* Team leads can manage RBAC settings for their teams independently.
* Visibility of other users' or teams' permissions is restricted.
* Administrators retain overarching control while delegating team-specific access.

.Prerequisites
* Your {product-very-short} instance is running with the RBAC plugin installed and configured.
* You have administrative access to {product-very-short}.
