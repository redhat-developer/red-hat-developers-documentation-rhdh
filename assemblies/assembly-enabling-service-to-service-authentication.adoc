= Enabling service-to-service authentication

To secure communication between services and verify identities without manual intervention, you can configure service-to-service authentication.
{product} can use this mechanism for plugin-to-plugin communication, and for external service to plugin communication.
{product-short} supports the following service-to-service authentication methods: 

* Static tokens
* JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS)

[IMPORTANT]
----
The availability of service-to-service authentication might vary for REST APIs. 
Each plugin defines the restrictions on this feature.
Consult your specific plugin's documentation for detailed limitations.

For example, the RBAC plugin supports exclusively all `GET` requests, but no `POST` requests.
