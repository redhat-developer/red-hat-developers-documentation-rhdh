= Enabling service-to-service authentication

Service-to-service authentication ensures that communication between different services is secure and that each service can verify the identity of the other, without requiring user intervention.
{product} can use this mechanism for plugin-to-plugin communication, and for external service to plugin communication.
{product-short} supports the following service-to-service authentication methods: 

* Static tokens
* JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS)
