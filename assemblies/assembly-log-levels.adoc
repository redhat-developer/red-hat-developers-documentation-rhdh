= Log Levels

With the {product} `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable, you can control the amount and type of data for your observability tool to collect. This ranges from highly detailed diagnostic output to information about only the most critical errors. The variable sets the minimum severity level of events to be logged. 

You can use either the {product-short} Operator or Helm chart to configure `LOG_LEVEL`.
