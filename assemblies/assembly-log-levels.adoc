= Log Levels

With the {product} `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable, you can control the amount and type of information that the application writes to its logs. This ranges from highly detailed diagnostic output to information about only the most critical errors. The variable sets the minimum severity level of events to be logged. 

You can use either the {product-short} Operator or Helm chart to configure `LOG_LEVEL`.
