= Log Levels

With the {product} `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable, you can control the amount and type of information for your observability tool to collect, ranging from highly detailed diagnostic output to the most critical errors. `LOG_LEVEL` sets the minimum severity level of events to be logged. 

{product-short} supports the following levels, which are listed in order of decreasing verbosity:

- `debug`: Detailed information, typically useful only when troubleshooting.
- `info`: General information about the operation of the application. This is the default level.
- `warn`: Indicates potential issues or situations that might require attention.
- `error`: Indicates errors that have occurred but might not prevent the application from continuing.
- `critical`: Indicates critical errors that require immediate attention and are likely to prevent the application from functioning correctly.
