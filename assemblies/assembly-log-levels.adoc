= Log Levels

You can choose from the following log levels, listed in order of decreasing verbosity:

- `debug`: Detailed information, typically useful only when troubleshooting.
- `info`: General information about the operation of the application. This is the default level.
- `warn`: Indicates potential issues or situations that might require attention.
- `error`: Indicates errors that have occurred but might not necessarily prevent the application from continuing.
- `critical`: Indicates critical errors that require immediate attention and likely prevent the application from functioning correctly.

You can control the verbosity of the logging by setting the log level. The log level determines the minimum severity level of events that are displayed in the console. For example, if the log level is set to 'info', events with a severity level of 'debug' are ignored.

To increase the log level, you can set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to a higher severity level, such as 'warn' or 'error'. However, increasing the log level might not result in more output if the existing code primarily emits logs at lower severity levels, for example, 'debug' or 'info'. In such cases, you might need to adjust the logging statements within the code to use higher severity levels to see more output.

No additional steps are required beyond setting the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable, but the effectiveness depends on the existing logging statements in the code.
