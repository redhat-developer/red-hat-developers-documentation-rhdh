= Monitoring collective health across sub-entities

You can use the {scorecard-plugin} to view the collective health of sub-entities within a parent entity, such as a `System` or `Domain``. This consolidated view helps you identify high-level health trends and risks across complex projects.

.Procedure

To enable aggregation, you must perform the following steps:

. Define relationships: Ensure sub-entities include the partOf relationship in their definition.

. Apply metadata labels: Add specific labels to the entity metadata to help the backend identify sub-entities.

. Enable aggregation: Toggle the aggregation setting in the parent entity view to display the consolidated score.

The Scorecard backend automatically calculates the parent score based on the results of all identified child entities.
