= Installing third-party plugins in {product}
:context: assembly-install-third-party-plugins-rhdh

You can install a third-party plugins in {product} without rebuilding the {product-very-short} application.

The location of the `dynamic-plugin-config.yaml` file depends on the deployment method. For more details, refer to xref:proc-config-dynamic-plugins-rhdh-operator_rhdh-installing-rhdh-plugins[Installing dynamic plugins with the {product} Operator] and xref:con-install-dynamic-plugin-helm_rhdh-installing-rhdh-plugins[Installing dynamic plugins using the Helm chart].

Plugins are defined in the `plugins` array within the `dynamic-plugin-config.yaml` file. Each plugin is represented as an object with the following properties:

* `package`: The plugin's package definition, which can be an OCI image, a TGZ file, a JavaScript package, or a directory path.
* `disabled`: A boolean value indicating whether the plugin is enabled or disabled.
* `integrity`: The integrity hash of the package, required for TGZ file and JavaScript packages.
* `pluginConfig`: The plugin's configuration. For backend plugins, this is optional; for frontend plugins, it is required. The `pluginConfig` is a fragment of the `app-config.yaml` file, and any added properties are merged with the {product-very-short} `app-config.yaml` file.

[NOTE]
====
You can also load dynamic plugins from another directory, though this is intended for development or testing purposes and is not recommended for production, except for plugins included in the {product-very-short} container image.
