= Installing dynamic plugins in {product}
:context: rhdh-installing-rhdh-plugins

The dynamic plugin support is based on the backend plugin manager package, which is a service that scans a configured root directory (`dynamicPlugins.rootDirectory` in the `app-config.yaml` file) for dynamic plugin packages and loads them dynamically.

You can use the dynamic plugins that come preinstalled with {product} or install external dynamic plugins from a public NPM registry.
