= Extending {product} with custom plugins

You can extend {product} with your own custom plugins, however, to add a custom plugin to the {product} pre-built container image you must bundle and install your custom plugin as a dynamic plugin.

[NOTE]
Standard Backstage deployments statically compile plugins into the application itself. {product} supports dynamic plugins, meaning plugins can be added to an existing instance without recompiling the underlying Backstage application.
