You can integrate {plugin-type-name} dynamic plugins into {product} to enhance its functionality without modifying its source code or rebuilding it. To add these plugins, export them as derived packages.

While exporting the plugin package, you must ensure that dependencies are correctly bundled or marked as shared, depending on their relationship to the {product-short} environment.

To integrate a {plugin-type-name} plugin into {product-short}:

. First, obtain the plugin's source code.
. Export the plugin as a dynamic plugin package. See xref:proc-export-third-party-plugins-rhdh_assembly-third-party-plugins[].
. Package and publish the dynamic plugin. See xref:assembly-package-publish-third-party-dynamic-plugin[].
. Install the plugin in the {product-short} environment. See xref:assembly-install-third-party-plugins-rhdh[].
