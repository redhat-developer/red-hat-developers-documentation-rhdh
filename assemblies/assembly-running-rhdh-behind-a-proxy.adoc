= Running the {product-very-short} application behind a corporate proxy

You can run the {product-very-short} application behind a corporate proxy by setting any of the following environment variables before starting the application:

* `HTTP_PROXY`: Denotes the proxy to use for HTTP requests.
* `HTTPS_PROXY`: Denotes the proxy to use for HTTPS requests.

Additionally, you can set the `NO_PROXY` environment variable to exclude certain domains from proxying. The variable value is a comma-separated list of hostnames that do not require a proxy to get reached, even if one is specified.
