= Locate resources and documentation using search

To locate software components, APIs, and technical documentation across the enterprise, use the centralized search feature in {product} ({product-very-short}). By indexing the entire software ecosystem, this tool helps you locate services, templates, and team members directly, without navigating through nested menus.

By using the search bar, you can access matching resources from the Software Catalog and TechDocs instantly. This unified access reduces the time spent switching between disparate documentation sites or service registries during the development lifecycle.
