= Finding and viewing Technical Documentation (TechDocs)

To manage and consume software documentation efficiently, locate and view TechDocs directly in the {product} ({product-very-short}) portal. You can review architecture diagrams, installation guides, and component details alongside corresponding software entities in a single interface

By centralizing documentation, you ensure that technical resources are always accessible within the context of the services you develop. This direct access eliminates the need to navigate disparate repositories when verifying software requirements or implementation details.
