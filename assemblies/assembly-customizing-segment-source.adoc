= Customizing Segment source

The `analytics-provider-segment` plugin sends the collected web analytics data to {company-name} by default. However, you can configure a new Segment source that receives web analytics data based on your needs. For configuration, you need a unique Segment write key that points to the Segment source.

[NOTE]
====
Create your own web analytics data collection notice for your application users.
