= Installing a TechDocs add-on

The `<ReportIssue />` add-on is preinstalled in your {product} instance and enabled by default. Like any other supported dynamic plugin, you can install external TechDocs add-ons by using either the Operator or Helm chart. Additionally, you can import compatible third-party add-ons, including add-ons that you create yourself, the same way that you import any other third-party dynamic plugin into {product}.
