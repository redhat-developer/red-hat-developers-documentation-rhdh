= Enabling the GitLab OAuth authentication provider

{product} includes a GitLab authentication provider that can authenticate users by using GitLab OAuth.

.Prerequistes

* You configured {product-short} with a custom config map and secret.

.Procedure
. To allow {product-short} to authenticate with Gitlab, create an OAuth Application in Gitlab.
+
Go to https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications[GitLab User settings > Applications], and click the *Add new application* button.

*Name*:: Enter your application name, such as `{product-short}`.
*Redirect URI*:: Enter the backend authentication URI set in {product-short}, such as `pass:c,a,q[http://_<APP_FQDN>_/api/auth/gitlab/handler/frame]`.
Due to a peculiarity with GitLab OAuth, ensure the URL has no trailing `/` after 'frame'.
*Scopes*:: Select the following scopes from the list and click *Save application*:
+
// NOTE: including here verbatim copy from Gitlab screen.
`read_user`::: Grants read-only access to the authenticated user's profile through the /user API endpoint, which includes username, public email, and full name.
Also grants access to read-only API endpoints under /users.
`read_repository`::: Grants read-only access to the authenticated user's profile through the /user API endpoint, which includes username, public email, and full name.
Also grants access to read-only API endpoints under /users.
`write_repository`::: Grants read/write access to repositories on private projects using Git-over-HTTP (not using the API).
`openid`::: Grants permission to authenticate with GitLab using OpenID Connect.
Also gives read-only access to the user's profile and group memberships.
`profile`::: Grants read-only access to the user's profile data using OpenID Connect.
`email`::: Grants read-only access to the user's primary email address using OpenID Connect.
+
Save the *Application ID* and *Secret* for the next step.

. Add your Gitlab credentials in your {product-short} secrets.
+
.. Edit your {product-short} secrets, such as `secrets-rhdh`.
+
.. Add the following key/value pairs:
+
`AUTH_GITLAB_CLIENT_ID`:: Enter the *Application ID* that you generated on GitLab, such as `4928c033ab3d592845c044a653bc20583baf84f2e67b954c6fdb32a532ab76c9`.
`AUTH_GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET`:: Enter the *Secret* that you generated on Gitlab, such as `gloas-f2c9c350759cc08346fbf94a476ae83c579c76dd629fc5eeef9dc21eedfe0475`.

. Set up the Gitlab authentication provider in your {product-short} custom configuration.
+
.. Edit your custom {product-short} config map, such as `app-config-rhdh`.
+
.. In the `app-config-rhdh.yaml` content, add the `gitlab` provider configuration under the root `auth` configuration, and enable the `gitlab` provider for sign-in:
+
.`app-config-rhdh.yaml` fragment
