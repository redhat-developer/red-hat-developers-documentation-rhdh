= About Software Catalogs

The metadata for the components in your Software Catalog is stored as YAML files that live alongside your code in your version control system. The version control repositories can include one or many metadata files. Software Catalog organizes items as entities, which include Components, Resources, and APIs, and other related types. Each entity includes associated metadata such as its owner, type, and other relevant details.

The Overview page for a component provides key information such as links to the source code, documentation, dependencies, and ownership details. You can customize this page with plugins to suit specific needs.
