= About Software Templates

Software Templates in {product} provide a streamlined way to create software components and publish them to different version control repositories like Git. Platform engineers create and maintain Software Templates in {product}.

You can configure Software Templates to create software components, and publish these components to Git repositories. Once the components are published to Git repositories, register these components in the Software Catalog.

A template is a form composed of different UI fields that is defined in a YAML file. Software Templates include _actions_, which are steps that are executed in sequential order and can be executed conditionally.
