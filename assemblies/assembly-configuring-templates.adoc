= Configuring templates

Configure templates to create software components, and publish these components to different locations, such as the {product} software catalog, or Git repositories.

A template is a form composed of different UI fields that is defined in a YAML file. Templates include _actions_, which are steps that are executed in sequential order and can be executed conditionally.
