= Configuring authorization in {product}

In link:{authorization-book-url}[{authentication-book-title}], you learnt how to authenticate users to {product}.
{product-short} knowns who the users are.

In this book, learn how to authorize users to perform actions in {product-short}.
Define what users can do in {product-short}.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security concept that controls access to resources in a system, and specifies a mapping between users of the system, and the actions they can perform on resources in the system.
You define roles with specific permissions, and then assign the roles to users and groups.

RBAC on {product-short} is built on top of the Permissions framework, which defines RBAC policies in code.
Rather than defining policies in code,
the {product-short} RBAC feature allows you
to define policies in a declarative fashion using a simple CSV based format.
You can define the policies by using {product-short} web interface or REST API, rather than editing the CSV directly.

To apply RBAC in {product-short}:

. The {product-short} administrator sets up the RBAC feature:
.. Enable the RBAC feature
.. Configure Policy Administrators

. The {product-short} policy administrator configures your RBAC policies:
.. Define roles with specific permissions
.. Assign the roles to users and groups
