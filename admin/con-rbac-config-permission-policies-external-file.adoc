= Configuration of permission policies defined in an external file

You can follow this approach of configuring the permission policies before starting the {product}. If permission policies are defined in an external file, then you can import the same file in the {product-short}. The permission policies need to be defined in Casbin rules format. For information about the Casbin rules format, see https://casbin.org/docs/category/the-basics[Basics of Casbin rules].

The following is an example of permission policies configuration:

`p, role:default/guests, catalog-entity, read, deny`

`p, role:default/guests, catalog.entity.create, create, deny`

`g, user:default/<USER_TO_ROLE>, role:default/guests`

If a defined permission does not contain an action associated with it, then add `use` as a policy. See the following example:

`p, role:default/guests, kubernetes.proxy, use, deny`

You can define the `policy.csv` file path in the `app-config.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    policies-csv-file: /some/path/rbac-policy.csv
----

== Mounting `policy.csv` file to the {product-short} Helm Chart

When the {product} is deployed with the Helm Chart, then you must define the `policy.csv` file by mounting it to the {product-short} Helm Chart. 

You can add your `policy.csv` file to the {product-short} Helm Chart by creating a `configMap` and mounting it.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the OCP using the OpenShift web console.
* {product} is installed and deployed using Helm Chart.
+
For more information about installing the {product} using Helm Chart, see xref:proc-install-rhdh-helm_admin-rhdh[]. 

.Procedure

. In Red Hat OpenShift, create a ConfigMap to hold the policies as shown in the following example:
+
--
.Example `ConfigMap`
[source]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: rbac-policy
  namespace: rhdh
data:
  rbac-policy.csv: |
    p, role:default/guests, catalog-entity, read, allow
    p, role:default/guests, catalog.entity.create, create, allow    
    
    g, user:default/<YOUR_USER>, role:default/guests
----
--

. In the {product-short} Helm Chart, go to *Root Schema -> Backstage chart schema -> Backstage parameters -> Backstage container additional volume mounts*.
. Select *Add Backstage container additional volume mounts* and add the following values:
+
--
* *mountPath*: `opt/app-root/src/rbac`
* *Name*: `rbac-policy`
--

. Add the RBAC policy to the *Backstage container additional volumes* in the {product-short} Helm Chart:
+
--
* *name*: `rbac-policy`
* *configMap*
** *defaultMode*: `420`
** *name*: `rbac-policy`
--

. Update the policy path in the `app-config.yaml` file as follows:
+
--
.Example `app-config.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    policies-csv-file: ./rbac/rbac-policy.csv
