= Role-based Access Control (RBAC) REST API

{product} provides RBAC REST API that you can use to manage the permissions and roles in the {product-short}. This API supports you to facilitate and automate the maintenance of {product-short} permission policies and roles.

Using the RBAC REST API, you can perform the following actions:

* Retrieve information about all permission policies or specific permission policies, or roles
* Create, update, or delete a permission policy or a role
* Retrieve permission policy information about static plugins

The RBAC REST API requires the following components:

*Authorization*

The RBAC REST API requires Bearer token authorization for the permitted user role. For development purposes, you can access a web console in a browser. When you refresh a token request in the list of network requests, you find the token in the response JSON.

`Authorization: Bearer $token`

For example, on the *Homepage* of the {product-short}, you can navigate to the *Network* tab and search for the `query?term=` network call. Alternatively, you can go to the *Catalog* page and select any network call with `entity-facets` to acquire the Bearer token. 

*HTTP methods*

The RBAC REST API supports the following HTTP methods for API requests:

* `GET`: Retrieves specified information from a specified resource endpoint
* `POST`: Creates or updates a resource
* `PUT`: Updates a resource
* `DELETE`: Deletes a resource

*Base URL*

The base URL for RBAC REST API requests is `pass:c[http://SERVER:PORT/api/permission/policies]`, such as `pass:c[http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies]`.

*Endpoints*

RBAC REST API endpoints, such as `/api/permission/policies/[kind]/[namespace]/[name]` for specified kind, namespace, and username, are the URI that you append to the base URL to access the corresponding resource.

Example request URL for `/api/permission/policies/[kind]/[namespace]/[name]` endpoint is:

`pass:c[http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies/user/default/johndoe]`

[NOTE]
====
If at least one permission is assigned to `user:default/johndoe`, then the example request URL mentioned previously returns a result if sent in a `GET` response with a valid authorization token. However, if permission is only assigned to roles, then the example request URL does not return an output.
====

*Request data*

HTTP `POST` requests in the RBAC REST API may require a JSON request body with data to accompany the request.

Example `POST` request URL and JSON request body data for
`pass:c[http://localhost:7007/api/permission/policies]`:

[source,json]
----
{
    "entityReference": "role:default/test",
    "permission": "catalog-entity",
    "policy": "delete",
    "effect": "allow"
}
----

*HTTP status codes*

The RBAC REST API supports the following HTTP status codes to return as responses:

* `200` OK: The request was successful.
* `201` Created: The request resulted in a new resource being successfully created.
* `204` No Content: The request was successful, but there is no additional content to send in the response payload.
* `400` Bad Request: input error with the request
* `401` Unauthorized: lacks valid authentication for the requested resource
* `403` Forbidden: refusal to authorize request
* `404` Not Found: could not find requested resource
* `409` Conflict: request conflict with the current state and the target resource
