= Monitoring and logging with Amazon Web Services (AWS) in {product}

In the {product}, monitoring and logging are facilitated through Amazon Web Services (AWS) integration. With features like Amazon CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and Amazon Prometheus for comprehensive logging, you can ensure the reliability, scalability, and compliance of your {product-short} application hosted on AWS infrastructure. 

This integration enables you to oversee, diagnose, and refine your applications in the Red Hat ecosystem, leading to an improved development and operational journey.

== Monitoring with Amazon Prometheus

{product} provides Prometheus metrics related to the running application. For more information about enabling or deploying Prometheus for EKS clusters, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/prometheus.html[Prometheus metrics] in the Amazon documentation.

To monitor {product-short} using https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/[Amazon Prometheus], you need to create an Amazon managed service for the Prometheus workspace and configure the ingestion of the Developer Hub Prometheus metrics. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-onboard-create-workspace.html[Create a workspace] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-onboard-ingest-metrics.html[Ingest Prometheus metrics to the workspace] sections in the Amazon documentation.

After ingesting Prometheus metrics into the created workspace, you can configure the metrics scraping to extract data from pods based on specific pod annotations.

=== Configuring annotations for monitoring

You can configure the annotations for monitoring in both Helm deployment and Operator-backed deployment.

Helm deployment::
+
--
To annotate the backstage pod for monitoring, update your `values.yaml` file as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
upstream:
  backstage:
    # --- TRUNCATED ---
    podAnnotations:
      prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'
      prometheus.io/path: '/metrics'
      prometheus.io/port: '7007'
      prometheus.io/scheme: 'http'
----
--

Operator-backed deployment::
+
--
.Procedure

. As an administrator of the operator, edit the default configuration to add Prometheus annotations as follows:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Update OPERATOR_NS accordingly
$ OPERATOR_NS=rhdh-operator
$ kubectl edit configmap backstage-default-config -n "${OPERATOR_NS}"
----

. Find the `deployment.yaml` key in the ConfigMap and add the annotations to the `spec.template.metadata.annotations` field as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
deployment.yaml: |-
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  # --- truncated ---
  spec:
    template:
      # --- truncated ---
      metadata:
        labels:
         rhdh.redhat.com/app:  # placeholder for 'backstage-<cr-name>'
        # --- truncated ---
        annotations:
          prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'
          prometheus.io/path: '/metrics'
          prometheus.io/port: '7007'
          prometheus.io/scheme: 'http'
  # --- truncated ---
----

. Save your changes.
--

.Verification

To verify if the scraping works:

. Use `kubectl` to port-forward the Prometheus console to your local machine as follows:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl --namespace=prometheus port-forward deploy/prometheus-server 9090
----

. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9090` to access the Prometheus console.
. Monitor relevant metrics, such as `process_cpu_user_seconds_total`.

== Logging with Amazon CloudWatch logs

Logging within the {product} relies on the https://github.com/winstonjs/winston[winston library]. By default, logs at the debug level are not recorded. To activate debug logs, you must set the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` to debug in your {product} instance.

=== Configuring the application log level

You can configure the application log level in both Helm deployment and Operator-backed deployment.

Helm deployment::
+
--
To update the logging level, add the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` in your Helm chart's `values.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
upstream:
  backstage:
    # --- Truncated ---
    extraEnvVars:
      - name: LOG_LEVEL
        value: debug
----
--

Operator-backed deployment::
+
--
You can modify the logging level by including the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` in your custom resource as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  # Other fields omitted
  application:
    extraEnvs:
      envs:
        - name: LOG_LEVEL
          value: debug
----
--

=== Retrieving logs from Amazon CloudWatch

The CloudWatch Container Insights are used to capture logs and metrics for Amazon EKS. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/implementing-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch/kubernetes-eks-logging.html[Logging for Amazon EKS] documentation.

To capture the logs and metrics, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-setup-EKS-addon.html[install the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on] in your cluster. Following the setup of Container Insights, you can access container logs using Logs Insights or Live Tail views.

CloudWatch names the log group where all container logs are consolidated in the following manner:

`/aws/containerinsights/<ClusterName>/application`

Following is an example query to retrieve logs from the Developer Hub instance:

[source,sql]
----
fields @timestamp, @message, kubernetes.container_name
| filter kubernetes.container_name in ["install-dynamic-plugins", "backstage-backend"]
----
